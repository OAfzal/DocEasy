Future Work:

Given the subjective nature of the task the idea is to solve it in the following way:

1. The above 5 levels is approximately where any human being can be classified

2. Age would be the first identifier in persona selection but the primary
    attribute would be the domain knowledge as right after the teenager level

3. The idea is to have a user_persona help in select a user_embedding which would
    then be personalized as the user prompts with the chatbot
    This could be achieved in a PEFT way where in the PEFT weights would be adjusted
    for the user

4. The user_embedding would essentally contain metadata about the user and theories
    knowledge. This is what would essentially determine how the explaining is done
