       "\"my name is bobby castillo i'm an assistant professor at the university of chicago and a neuroscientist at argonne national labs what the connectome is is it's a kind of a newly made up term for describing a kind of neuroscience research where we try to map the brain at a scale that's never been met before every person here can leave with understanding it at some level [Music] do you know why we're here today because we're talking about science yes we're going to talk about science and we're going to talk about a very specific kind of science about people who study brains do you know what a brain is what is it things um so what we're going to talk about this is something that people study in the brain called the connect tone do you know that your body is made up of really tiny things called cells um yes okay well there's more cells in your brain like way more cells than than all the stars we can see and so what the connectome is is we'd like to know where every cell in your brain is and how it talks to every other cell in your brain that was awesome daniel thank you connect tone connect tone to be honest i have no idea that's good that's a great place to start there are cells in your brain those brain cells are connected by wires to each other electricity travels down those wires and communicates from one part of the brain to the other part of the brain and each of those brain cells makes you know a thousand connections something like a hundred trillion connections in one brain in your brain if could i take all of that information and put it inside a computer would that computer then be you computers they don't have feelings they won't have feelings and i think that's one thing that makes the human race wrong i would say that that map also has your feelings in it because here's why your feelings most neuroscientists think come from your brain anyway and amazingly whether when you feel happy or sad or angry or scared that's just brain cells communicating with each other [Music] so i think today we're going to talk about a connectome do you have you ever heard of that a connect home yeah no awesome i don't think so it's a map of all the connections between every neuron in your brain uh literally in a human brain something like the map of the one quadrillion connections that 100 billion neurons make with each other is this like a a map where that's like an actual visual representation like using microscopy or just data wow wow i'm understanding more so that it's these these the a mapping of the neuro the circuitry the pathways between neurons that can lead to evidence of patterns in your brain that are common between different people we have to use electron microscopes and then what we have been developing are ways to slice the brain into really thin slices use an electron microscope to take a picture of each slice and then use computers to put it all back imagine that we could get the map of every connection right and we knew how neurons fired do you think we could put that in a computer that map and then therefore that computer should be able to think just like the brain that we extracted it from well the computer only communicates with itself in binary so it only has two options it can only ask itself yes or no questions but a human brain has an infinity of directions that it can go neurons are also digital uh meaning a neuron either fires or it doesn't fire so that's either one or a zero and it's the combination of those ones or zeros that actually produce the 10 000 different answers that you say [Music] it's a large scale attempt to understand the wiring map of the brain actually great i think that it's definitely needed understanding the anatomy of the brain is definitely important but it doesn't necessarily tell us everything about the function so there's some sort of temporal order from neuron to neuron and region to region that we may not be able to pick up this is where it gets really crazy could we simulate that map inside a computer and would that computer then be thinking like that original brain for which we made the map i mean that's not that's not the person i mean having a representation of someone's neural network is just that it's just a representation of their neural network i mean because there's more to the to you in here than just information passing between neurons i'd like to think so it would be like if you simulated a hurricane imagine we could keep track of every variable of a hurricane wind speed every water molecule etc etc temperature and we put that inside a super fast computer and we simulated it right i don't think anyone would think that the inside of the computer would get wet even though we had simulated the hurricane perfectly that wetness is consciousness is what we are is it ethical to imagine mapping a male brain versus a female brain to look for differences between those to explain alleged behavioral differences between them every single person is different and so it should be okay to map every single person's brain i mean i understand that there are that it's very sensitive you know what do you think is sensitive mapping an indian brain versus a caucasian brain or politically i think that people may have some issue with mapping out what causes or what makes a difference between different types of people maybe a wiring diagram is not sufficient to understand the brain and it would be crazy to think that that would be sufficient actually if you limit the connectom to be just the wiring diagram without you know more information about uh myelination or glial cells correct all types of environmental features that surround you know the neurons and axons then then you have an incomplete picture right no doubt sometimes when people get um they worry about connectomics i think what they're actually worrying about is that it's the end of the way that we used to do neuroscience what do you think about memory do you think that there's um ways of resolving what the substrate of human memory is you know is it just ltp and lcd i'm not sure if you had a connectome of a human brain of an adult human i would be able to read out memories from that you don't think it's just the synaptic weights like an artificial neural network it's trained to do particularly it could absolutely be but without knowing what the weights were before the memory was made what if you had a violinist learn a piece of bach music yes could you find those notes somewhere in their brain yes they didn't know before yes um you know i'm a musician and i don't think it's possible i think that there are too many you know so much of it is associative to what you already know uh-huh and as a musician how much of it do you think is in your hands versus in your brains uh meaning like you do have connections in your muscles from the nerves that are from your spinal cord uh what if some of the learning is there are you still doing em or yeah i mean we do a lot of x-ray in addition to em and this is actually i'm not saying it's the only problem but it's the only problem that needs to be solved right away is that the data analysis right in fact i think we calculated that there aren't enough humans ever to map a mouse brain uh uh where will you collect every connection and uh etc so the problem is to get algorithms to to trace to recognize things in brains the way humans uh uh recognize things in brains or map things trace things in brains it's going to cost a lot of money uh to imagine setting the gold standard for the wiring diagram even once and that's what i'm those are the kinds of ethical concerns that i'm worried about one of the things that we're not doing well as a field is sort of educating and telling people beyond our field the benefits of what we can achieve and i'm impressed that when you talk to people about something that seems kind of crazy and outlandish and perhaps they hadn't been talking about before it doesn't take them long to come to a kind of considered opinion especially children i think it's kind of amazing i mean i do hope that more people talk about brains and what we use brains for and the ways that we shouldn't use our brains so i think this field has the opportunity to make that more real \""

Materials and Methods Forty data sets from 39 patients (mean age ± standard deviation [SD], 67 years ± 8), including 16 male patients and 23 female patients (mean age, 66 years ± 6 and 68 years ± 9, respectively), who underwent simultaneous amyloid (fluorine 18 [18F]-florbetaben) PET/MRI examinations were acquired from March 2016 through October 2017 and retrospectively analyzed. One hundredth of the raw list-mode PET data were randomly chosen to simulate a low-dose (1%) acquisition. Convolutional neural networks were implemented with low-dose PET and multiple MR images (PET-plus-MR model) or with low-dose PET alone (PET-only) as inputs to predict full-dose PET images. Quality of the synthesized images was evaluated while Bland-Altman plots assessed the agreement of regional standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) between image types. Two readers scored image quality on a five-point scale (5 = excellent) and determined amyloid status (positive or negative). Statistical analyses were carried out to assess the difference of image quality metrics and reader agreement and to determine confidence intervals (CIs) for reading results. Results The synthesized images (especially from the PET-plus-MR model) showed marked improvement on all quality metrics compared with the low-dose image. All PET-plus-MR images scored 3 or higher, with proportions of images rated greater than 3 similar to those for the full-dose images (-10% difference [eight of 80 readings], 95% CI: -15%, -5%). Accuracy for amyloid status was high (71 of 80 readings [89%]) and similar to intrareader reproducibility of full-dose images (73 of 80 [91%]). The PET-plus-MR model also had the smallest mean and variance for SUVR difference to full-dose images.

Materials and Methods Forty data sets from 39 patients (mean age ± standard deviation [SD], 67 years ± 8), including 16 male patients and 23 female patients (mean age, 66 years ± 6 and 68 years ± 9, respectively), who underwent simultaneous amyloid (fluorine 18 [18F]-florbetaben) PET/MRI examinations were acquired from March 2016 through October 2017 and retrospectively analyzed. One hundredth of the raw list-mode PET data were randomly chosen to simulate a low-dose (1%) acquisition. Convolutional neural networks were implemented with low-dose PET and multiple MR images (PET-plus-MR model) or with low-dose PET alone (PET-only) as inputs to predict full-dose PET images. Quality of the synthesized images was evaluated while Bland-Altman plots assessed the agreement of regional standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) between image types. Two readers scored image quality on a five-point scale (5 = excellent) and determined amyloid status (positive or negative). Statistical analyses were carried out to assess the difference of image quality metrics and reader agreement and to determine confidence intervals (CIs) for reading results. Results The synthesized images (especially from the PET-plus-MR model) showed marked improvement on all quality metrics compared with the low-dose image.

       "  'output': \"Before undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery for Parkinson's disease, patients are assessed for candidacy through neuropsychological testing. Poor memory performance is often seen as a reason to not undergo surgery. Patients with Parkinson's disease may have worse memory for word lists than for stories due to the lack of organization in a list of unrelated words. However, word list and story tasks are typically developed from different normative datasets, and the existence of a memory performance discrepancy in Parkinson's disease has been challenged. A study was conducted comparing recall of stories and word lists in 35 non-demented Parkinson's disease candidates for DBS. The results showed that age-corrected scores were higher for the story task than for both word list tasks. Word list recall correlated more consistently with motor severity and composite measures of processing speed, working memory, and executive functioning. This suggests that executive deficits may influence word list recall more than story recall. Therefore, a multi-componential memory battery should be used in the neuropsychological assessment of DBS candidates to characterize both mesial temporal and frontal-executive memory processes. One should not rely solely on a word list task because patients exhibiting poor memory for word lists may perform better with stories and therefore deserve an interdisciplinary discussion for DBS surgery.\"},\n",

The goal of our approach is to achieve an anti-kindling, where the affected neural networks unlearn abnormal synaptic connectivity and, hence, abnormal neuronal synchrony, by means of desynchronizing stimulation, in particular, Coordinated Reset (CR) stimulation. As known from neuroscience, psychology and education, learning effects can be enhanced by means of the spacing principle, i.e. by delivering repeated stimuli spaced by pauses as opposed to delivering a massed stimulus (in a single long stimulation session). To illustrate that the spacing principle may boost the anti-kindling effect of CR neuromodulation, in this computational study we carry this approach to extremes. To this end, we deliver spaced CR neuromodulation at particularly weak intensities which render permanently delivered CR neuromodulation ineffective. Intriguingly, spaced CR neuromodulation at these particularly weak intensities effectively induces an anti-kindling. In fact, the spacing principle enables the neuronal population to successively hop from one attractor to another one, finally approaching attractors characterized by down-regulated synaptic connectivity and synchrony. Our computational results might open up novel opportunities to effectively induce sustained desynchronization at particularly weak stimulation intensities, thereby avoiding side effects, e.g., in the case of deep brain stimulation.',\n",

Many video stabilization methods have been proposed to stabilize shaky videos. However, most methods estimate one global homography or several homographies based on fixed meshes to warp the shaky frames into their stabilized views. Due to the existence of parallax, such single or a few homographies can not well handle the depth variation. In contrast to these traditional methods, we propose a novel video stabilization network, called PWStableNet, which comes up pixel-wise warping maps, i.e., potentially different warping for different pixels, and stabilizes each pixel to its stabilized view. To our best knowledge, this is the first deep learning based pixel-wise video stabilization. The proposed method is built upon a multi-stage cascade encoder-decoder architecture and learns pixel-wise warping maps from consecutive unstable frames. Inter-stage connections are also introduced to add feature maps of a former stage to the corresponding feature maps at a latter stage, which enables the latter stage to learn the residual from the feature maps of former stages. This cascade architecture can produce more precise warping maps at latter stages. To ensure the correct learning of pixel-wise warping maps, we use a well-designed loss function to guide the training procedure of the proposed PWStableNet.

The Fos response to odors is typified by the activity of relatively few juxtaglomerular cells, which often occur in foci, and a large number of granule cells extending through much of the bulb. In this study, we characterized the granule cell response to an odor for which young rats had acquired a preference.

We describe Dixon-VIBE Deep Learning (DIVIDE), a deep-learning network that allows synthesizing pelvis pseudo-CT maps based only on the standard Dixon volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination (Dixon-VIBE) images currently acquired for AC in some commercial scanners. Methods: We propose a network that maps between the four 2-dimensional (2D) Dixon MR images (water, fat, in-phase, and out-of-phase) and their corresponding 2D CT image. In contrast to previous methods, we used transposed convolutions to learn the up-sampling parameters, we used whole 2D slices to provide context information, and we pretrained the network with brain images. Twenty-eight datasets obtained from 19 patients who underwent PET/CT and PET/MR examinations were used to evaluate the proposed method. We assessed the accuracy of the μ-maps and reconstructed PET images by performing voxel- and region-based analysis comparing the SUVs (in g/mL) obtained after AC using the Dixon-VIBE (PETDixon), DIVIDE (PETDIVIDE), and CT-based (PETCT) methods. Additionally, the bias in quantification was estimated in synthetic lesions defined in the prostate, rectum, pelvis, and spine. Results: Absolute mean relative change values relative to CT AC were lower than 2% on average for the DIVIDE method in every region of interest except for bone tissue, where it was lower than 4% and 6.75 times smaller than the relative change of the Dixon method. There was an excellent voxel-by-voxel correlation between PETCT and PETDIVIDE (R 2 = 0.9998, P < 0.01). The Bland-Altman plot between PETCT and PETDIVIDE showed that the average of the differences and the variability were lower (mean PETCT-PETDIVIDE SUV, 0.0003; PETCT-PETDIVIDE SD, 0.0094; 95% confidence interval, [-0.0180,0.0188]) than the average of differences between PETCT and PETDixon (mean PETCT-PETDixon SUV, 0.0006; PETCT-PETDixon SD, 0.0264; 95% confidence interval, [-0.0510,0.0524]). Statistically significant changes in PET data quantification were observed between the 2 methods in the synthetic lesions, with the largest improvement in femur and spine lesions. Conclusion: The DIVIDE method can accurately synthesize a pelvis pseudo-CT scan from standard Dixon-VIBE images, allowing for accurate AC in combined PET/MR scanners.

Some of the goals of clinical practice and those of commercial developers of psychiatric therapies overlap, such as developing safe and effective treatments. However, there might also be incompatible goals; physicians aim to provide the best care they can to their patients, whereas the medical industry ultimately aims to develop therapies that are commercially successful. In some cases, however, clinical research may be aiming both at improved patient care and commercial success. It is in these cases that a conflict of interest (COI) arises. The goal of this study was to identify differences and commonalities regarding COIs between 2 kinds of somatic psychiatric interventions: pharmacological and neurosurgical. METHODS The authors conducted a study focused on professional concerns regarding pharmacological and neurosurgical psychiatric interventions. They used medical and bioethics journal articles as an indicator of professionals' concerns and carried out a thematic content analysis of peer-reviewed articles published between 1960 and 2015, using PubMed and Google Scholar.

In the context of healthcare, AI can be used to analyze medical images, predict disease outcomes, and even assist in surgical procedures. However, the use of AI in healthcare raises questions about the doctor-patient relationship.\\n\\nTraditionally, the doctor-patient relationship has been based on trust, empathy, and communication. Patients rely on their doctors to provide them with accurate diagnoses, effective treatments, and emotional support. Doctors, in turn, rely on their patients to provide them with accurate information about their symptoms, medical history, and lifestyle.\\n\\nWith the introduction of AI, some doctors worry that the doctor-patient relationship may be compromised. For example, if a machine is making decisions about a patient's treatment, the patient may feel like they are not being heard or understood. Additionally, if a machine is analyzing medical images, the doctor may feel like they are being replaced by a machine.\\n\\nHowever, proponents of AI argue that it can actually enhance the doctor-patient relationship. For example, AI can help doctors make more accurate diagnoses and provide more personalized treatment plans. Additionally, AI can help patients better understand their medical conditions and make more informed decisions about their healthcare.\\n\\nIn the context of breast imaging radiology, AI has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of mammography screenings. AI algorithms can analyze mammograms and identify potential areas of concern, allowing radiologists to focus their attention on those areas. This can lead to earlier detection of breast cancer and better outcomes for patients.\\n\\nOverall, the integration of AI into healthcare is a complex issue that requires careful consideration.

We propose an evolutionary algorithm that can generate adversarial examples for any machine learning model in the black-box attack scenario. This way, we can find adversarial examples without access to model's parameters, only by querying the model at hand. We have tested a range of machine learning models including deep and shallow neural networks. Our experiments have shown that the vulnerability to adversarial examples is not only the problem of deep networks, but it spreads through various machine learning architectures. Rather, it depends on the type of computational units. Local units, such as Gaussian kernels, are less vulnerable to adversarial examples.\",\n",

It is trained on papers annotated by ClinGen curators and systematically evaluated on new test data collected by ClinGen. LitGen further leverages rich human explanations and unlabeled data to gain 7.9%-12.6% relative performance improvement over models learned only on the annotated papers. It is a useful framework to improve clinical variant curation.',\n",

However, there are two problems that make it difficult to accurately trace the shape of the neurons from these pictures. First, the labeling of the neurons can be uneven, making it hard to see where one neuron ends and another begins. Second, the resolution of the pictures is limited, so it can be hard to tell if two neurites (the branches of a neuron) are actually connected or just close together.\\n\\nTo solve these problems, the scientists in this study used artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance the images. ANNs are computer programs that can learn to recognize patterns in data, and they are often used in image processing tasks. The scientists tested several different ANN architectures and compared them to conventional image enhancement filters.\\n\\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the filters, the scientists developed four metrics to measure the quality of the images. These metrics looked at things like the intensity of the neurites, the thickness of the neurites, and the background noise in the images.\\n\\nThe results showed that the ANN-based filters were much better than the conventional filters at improving the quality of the images. In particular, the U-Net based filter was able to eliminate background noise and make the neurites appear much thinner.

       "  'input': 'Deep Learning in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.\\nGastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is used to inspect the lumen or interior of the GI tract for several purposes, including, (1) making a clinical diagnosis, in real time, based on the visual appearances; (2) taking targeted tissue samples for subsequent histopathological examination; and (3) in some cases, performing therapeutic interventions targeted at specific lesions. GI endoscopy is therefore predicated on the assumption that the operator-the endoscopist-is able to identify and characterize abnormalities or lesions accurately and reproducibly. However, as in other areas of clinical medicine, such as histopathology and radiology, many studies have documented marked interobserver and intraobserver variability in lesion recognition. Thus, there is a clear need and opportunity for techniques or methodologies that will enhance the quality of lesion recognition and diagnosis and improve the outcomes of GI endoscopy. Deep learning models provide a basis to make better clinical decisions in medical image analysis. Biomedical image segmentation, classification, and registration can be improved with deep learning. Recent evidence suggests that the application of deep learning methods to medical image analysis can contribute significantly to computer-aided diagnosis. Deep learning models are usually considered to be more flexible and provide reliable solutions for image analysis problems compared to conventional computer vision models. The use of fast computers offers the possibility of real-time support that is important for endoscopic diagnosis, which has to be made in real time. Advanced graphics processing units and cloud computing have also favored the use of machine learning, and more particularly, deep learning for patient care.

They have emerged as the machine-learning method of choice in solving image and speech recognition problems, and their potential has raised the expectation of similar breakthroughs in other fields of study. In this work, we compared three machine-learning methods-DNN, random forest (a popular conventional method), and variable nearest neighbor (arguably the simplest method)-in their ability to predict the molecular activities of 21 in vivo and in vitro data sets. Surprisingly, the overall performance of the three methods was similar. For molecules with structurally close near neighbors in the training sets, all methods gave reliable predictions, whereas for molecules increasingly dissimilar to the training molecules, all three methods gave progressively poorer predictions. For molecules sharing little to no structural similarity with the training molecules, all three methods gave a nearly constant value-approximately the average activity of all training molecules-as their predictions. The results confirm conclusions deduced from analyzing molecular applicability domains for accurate predictions, i.e., the most important determinant of the accuracy of predicting a molecule is its similarity to the training samples. This highlights the fact that even in the age of deep learning, developing a truly high-quality model relies less on the choice of machine-learning approach and more on the availability of experimental efforts to generate sufficient training data of structurally diverse compounds. The results also indicate that the distance to training molecules offers a natural and intuitive basis for defining applicability domains to flag reliable and unreliable quantitative structure-activity relationship predictions.',\n",

Complement with prior-knowledge similarities is a feasible way to tackle the problem. However, classical combination machine learning algorithms fail in detection and application of the complex mapping relations between similarities and conditional relatedness, so a powerful predictive model will have enormous benefit for measuring this kind of complex mapping relations. To this need, we propose a novel deep learning model of convolutional neural network with a fully connected first layer, named fully convolutional neural network (FCNN), to measure conditional relatedness between genes using both co-expression and prior-knowledge similarities. The results on validation and test datasets show FCNN model yields an average 3.0% and 2.7% higher accuracy values for identifying gene-gene interactions collected from the COXPRESdb, KEGG, and TRRUST databases, and a benchmark dataset of Xiao-Yong et al. research, by grid-search 10-fold cross validation, respectively.

Given the global health emergency, drug repositioning is the most reliable option to design an efficient therapy for infected patients without delay. The first step of the viral replication cycle [i.e. attachment to the surface of respiratory cells, mediated by the spike (S) viral protein] offers several potential therapeutic targets. The S protein uses the angiotension-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor for entry, but also sialic acids linked to host cell surface gangliosides. Using a combination of structural and molecular modelling approaches, this study showed that chloroquine (CLQ), one of the drugs currently under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 treatment, binds sialic acids and gangliosides with high affinity. A new type of ganglioside-binding domain at the tip of the N-terminal domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was identified. This domain (111-158), which is fully conserved among clinical isolates worldwide, may improve attachment of the virus to lipid rafts and facilitate contact with the ACE-2 receptor. This study showed that, in the presence of CLQ [or its more active derivative, hydroxychloroquine (CLQ-OH)], the viral S protein is no longer able to bind gangliosides. The identification of this new mechanism of action of CLQ and CLQ-OH supports the use of these repositioned drugs to cure patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

However, it is not a cure for the virus and should not be relied upon as the sole treatment for COVID-19. It is important to continue following public health guidelines, such as wearing masks and practicing social distancing, to help prevent the spread of the virus.'},\n",

       "  'input': \"Can melatonin reduce the severity of COVID-19 pandemic?\\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most devastating events in recent history. The virus causes relatively minor damage to young, healthy populations, imposing life-threatening danger to the elderly and people with diseases of chronic inflammation. Therefore, if we could reduce the risk for vulnerable populations, it would make the COVID-19 pandemic more similar to other typical outbreaks. Children don't suffer from COVID-19 as much as their grandparents and have a much higher melatonin level. Bats are nocturnal animals possessing high levels of melatonin, which may contribute to their high anti-viral resistance. Viruses induce an explosion of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, and melatonin is the best natural antioxidant that is lost with age. The programmed cell death coronaviruses cause, which can result in significant lung damage, is also inhibited by melatonin. Coronavirus causes inflammation in the lungs which requires inflammasome activity. Melatonin blocks these inflammasomes. General immunity is impaired by anxiety and sleep deprivation. Melatonin improves sleep habits, reduces anxiety and stimulates immunity. Fibrosis may be the most dangerous complication after COVID-19. Melatonin is known to prevent fibrosis. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary but yet imposes risks due to oxidative stress, which can be reduced by melatonin. Thus, by using the safe over-the-counter drug melatonin, we may be immediately able to prevent the development of severe disease symptoms in coronavirus patients, reduce the severity of their symptoms, and/or reduce the immuno-pathology of coronavirus infection on patients' health after the active phase of the infection is over.\",\n",

       "  'input': \"Specific ACE2 Expression in Small Intestinal Enterocytes may Cause Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Injury after 2019-nCoV Infection.\\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread in other countries in December 2019. The infected patients presented with fever, respiratory symptoms, sometimes with digestive and other systemic manifestations, and some progressed with a severe acute respiratory syndrome or even death. Associated digestive symptoms were frequently observed in the patients, with an unknown significance and mechanism. ACE2, as the major known functional receptor of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) attracted our attention. We collected the clinical data of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients from published studies and extracted the data about the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Furthermore, we used online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs, especially in the small intestine, to explore the relationship between ACE2 expression patterns and clinical symptoms. We found that diarrhea accounted for a notable proportion of COVID-19 patients, ranging from 8.0% to 12.9%. The results reveal that ACE2 mRNA and protein are highly expressed in the small intestinal enterocytes but not in the goblet cells or intestinal immune cells. High expression of ACE2 on the surface cells in the digestive tract may lead to gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation susceptibility. Overall, digestive symptoms were common in the COVID-19 patients. ACE2 expression on surface cells of the small intestine may mediate the invasion and amplification of the virus and activation of gastrointestinal inflammation. It is a possible mechanism of digestive symptoms in the COVID-19 patients and explains the presence of the virus in patients' stool samples. The study also highlights the necessity of taking stool samples for suspected patients to help in early diagnosis and assessment of disease status.\",\n",
       "  'output': 'The article discusses how COVID-19 patients often experience gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea, and how this may be related to the high expression of ACE2 in the small intestine. ACE2 is a receptor that the virus uses to enter cells, and its high expression in the small intestine may lead to inflammation and other symptoms. The study suggests that taking stool samples from suspected patients can help with early diagnosis and assessment of disease status.'},\n",

       "  'output': 'Fruit flies use their ellipsoid body (EB) to maintain spatial orientation during movements. The circuitry and mechanisms behind this functionality are not fully understood. Researchers analyzed cellular-level connectomic data and found that the EB circuitry features coupled symmetric and asymmetric rings. The symmetric ring initiates a feedback circuit that sustains persistent neural activity to encode information regarding spatial orientation, while the asymmetric rings integrate the angular path when the body rotates in the dark. A spiking neural circuit model based on the connectome was constructed, which reproduces key features of EB activity and makes experimentally testable predictions. This provides new insight into how spatial orientation is maintained and tracked at the cellular level.'},\n",

This review, which considers opiates, methamphetamine, and cocaine, emphasizes the importance of host genetics and glial plasticity in driving the pathogenic neuron remodeling underlying neuro-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and drug abuse comorbidity. Clinical findings are less concordant than experimental work, and the response of individuals to HIV and to drug abuse can vary tremendously. Host-genetic variability is important in determining viral tropism, neuropathogenesis, drug responses, and addictive behavior. However, genetic differences alone cannot account for individual variability in the brain \"connectome.\" Environment and experience are critical determinants in the evolution of synaptic circuitry throughout life. Neurons and glia both exercise control over determinants of synaptic plasticity that are disrupted by HIV and drug abuse. Perivascular macrophages, microglia, and to a lesser extent astroglia can harbor the infection. Uninfected bystanders, especially astroglia, propagate and amplify inflammatory signals. Drug abuse by itself derails neuronal and glial function, and the outcome of chronic exposure is maladaptive plasticity. The negative consequences of coexposure to HIV and drug abuse are determined by numerous factors including genetics, sex, age, and multidrug exposure. Glia and some neurons are generated throughout life, and their progenitors appear to be targets of HIV and opiates/psychostimulants.

We examined cortical-subcortical circuitry engaging anterior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and midbrain. We hypothesized that schizophrenia-related deficits in prefrontal function might overestimate context change probabilities, and that this more chaotic worldview may subsequently gain familiarity and be over-reinforced, with implications for delusions. We then examined these opposing information processing biases against less expected versus familiar information patterns in relation to genetic risk for schizophrenia in unaffected siblings. In one experiment, 17 patients with schizophrenia and 24 normal control subjects were presented in 3 T magnetic resonance imaging with numerical information varying noisily about a context integer, which occasionally shifted up or down. Subjects were to indicate when the inferred numerical context had changed. We fitted Bayesian models to estimate probabilities associated with change inferences. Dynamic causal models examined cortical-subcortical circuitry interactions at context change inference, and at subsequent reduced uncertainty. In a second experiment, genetic risk for schizophrenia associated with similar cortical-subcortical findings were explored in an independent sample of 36 normal control subjects and 35 unaffected siblings during processing of intuitive number sequences along the number line, or during the inverse, less familiar, sequence. In the first experiment, reduced Bayesian models fitting subject behaviour suggest that patients with schizophrenia overestimated context change probabilities. Here, patients engaged anterior prefrontal cortex relatively less than healthy controls, in part driven by reduced effective connectivity from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to anterior prefrontal cortex.

These findings suggest that Stroop performance is reflected in resting state functional properties of certain brain areas and networks, and that default brain activity and higher cognitive processes in these areas underlie better Stroop performance.'},\n",

Besides memory advantages in the famous condition, we found that post-encoding hippocampal connectivity with the fusiform face area (FFA) and ventral-medial-prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was stronger following encoding of associations with famous than non-famous faces. Importantly, post-encoding functional connectivity between the hippocampus (HPC) and FFA, and between the anterior temporal pole region (aTPL) and posterior perceptual regions (i.e., FFA and the parahippocampal place area), together predicted a large proportion of the variance in subsequent memory performance. This prediction was specific for face-house associative memory, not face/house item memory, and only in the famous condition where prior knowledge was involved.

Dynamic network theory has been used to identify properties of dynamic brain function from fMRI data, but the majority of analyses and findings remain at the level of the group. Here, we apply hypergraph analysis, a method from dynamic network theory, to quantify individual differences in brain functional dynamics. Using a summary metric derived from the hypergraph formalism-hypergraph cardinality-we investigate individual variations in two separate, complementary data sets. The first data set (\"multi-task\") consists of 77 individuals engaging in four consecutive cognitive tasks. We observe that hypergraph cardinality exhibits variation across individuals while remaining consistent within individuals between tasks; moreover, the analysis of one of the memory tasks revealed a marginally significant correspondence between hypergraph cardinality and age. This finding motivated a similar analysis of the second data set (\"age-memory\"), in which 95 individuals, aged 18-75, performed a memory task with a similar structure to the multi-task memory task.

In fact, hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment is now included in the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. However, there are children with sensory processing differences who do not meet an ASD diagnosis but do show atypical sensory behaviors to the same or greater degree as ASD children. We previously demonstrated that children with Sensory Processing Disorders (SPD) have impaired white matter microstructure, and that this white matter microstructural pathology correlates with atypical sensory behavior. In this study, we use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fiber tractography to evaluate the structural connectivity of specific white matter tracts in boys with ASD (n\\u200a=\\u200a15) and boys with SPD (n\\u200a=\\u200a16), relative to typically developing children (n\\u200a=\\u200a23). We define white matter tracts using probabilistic streamline tractography and assess the strength of tract connectivity using mean fractional anisotropy. Both the SPD and ASD cohorts demonstrate decreased connectivity relative to controls in parieto-occipital tracts involved in sensory perception and multisensory integration. However, the ASD group alone shows impaired connectivity, relative to controls, in temporal tracts thought to subserve social-emotional processing. In addition to these group difference analyses, we take a dimensional approach to assessing the relationship between white matter connectivity and participant function. These correlational analyses reveal significant associations of white matter connectivity with auditory processing, working memory, social skills, and inattention across our three study groups. These findings help elucidate the roles of specific neural circuits in neurodevelopmental disorders, and begin to explore the dimensional relationship between critical cognitive functions and structural connectivity across affected and unaffected children.',\n",

Therefore, we cross-sectionally investigated the association between damage to short- and long-range connections with structural network efficiency, the functional connectome and cognition. From the Amsterdam multiple sclerosis cohort, 133 patients (age = 54.2 ± 9.6) with long-standing multiple sclerosis and 48 healthy controls (age = 50.8 ± 7.0) with neuropsychological testing and MRI were included. Structural connectivity was estimated from diffusion tensor images using probabilistic tractography (MRtrix 3.0) between pairs of brain regions. Structural connections were divided into short- (length < quartile 1) and long-range (length > quartile 3) connections, based on the mean distribution of tract lengths in healthy controls. To determine the severity of damage within these connections, (i) fractional anisotropy as a measure for integrity; (ii) total number of fibres; and (iii) percentage of tract affected by lesions were computed for each connecting tract and averaged for short- and long-range connections separately. To investigate the impact of damage in these connections for structural network efficiency, global efficiency was computed. Additionally, resting-state functional connectivity was computed between each pair of brain regions, after artefact removal with FMRIB's ICA-based X-noiseifier.

Scientists want to understand how these connections work, but it's a difficult problem to solve because there are so many connections and they are very complex. \\n\\nOne way to solve this problem is to use a mathematical technique called matrix regression. This technique can help us find patterns in the connections between different parts of the brain. However, this technique is very difficult to use for the whole brain because there are so many connections to consider.\\n\\nTo solve this problem, scientists have developed a new algorithm called the greedy low-rank algorithm. This algorithm breaks down the problem into smaller parts and solves each part separately. It does this by approximating the solution with a sequence of rank-one updates, which means it looks for patterns in the connections that are similar to each other.\\n\\nThe algorithm is able to do this because the connectome has a sparse and positive definite structure, which means that there are only a few connections between different parts of the brain and they are all positive. This makes it easier to find patterns in the connections.\\n\\nThe algorithm has been tested on three different datasets, including an artificial dataset and two whole-cortex instances using data from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas. The results show that the algorithm is significantly faster than previous methods and that moderate ranks offer a good approximation.\\n\\nThis algorithm is important because it allows scientists to study the connectome in more detail and understand how different parts of the brain communicate with each other. It also allows them to study larger datasets, which will help them understand the brain on a larger scale.\"},\n",

       "  'input': 'Greedy low-rank algorithm for spatial connectome regression.\\nRecovering brain connectivity from tract tracing data is an important computational problem in the neurosciences. Mesoscopic connectome reconstruction was previously formulated as a structured matrix regression problem (Harris et al. in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2016), but existing techniques do not scale to the whole-brain setting. The corresponding matrix equation is challenging to solve due to large scale, ill-conditioning, and a general form that lacks a convergent splitting. We propose a greedy low-rank algorithm for the connectome reconstruction problem in very high dimensions. The algorithm approximates the solution by a sequence of rank-one updates which exploit the sparse and positive definite problem structure. This algorithm was described previously (Kressner and Sirković in Numer Lin Alg Appl 22(3):564-583, 2015) but never implemented for this connectome problem, leading to a number of challenges. We have had to design judicious stopping criteria and employ efficient solvers for the three main sub-problems of the algorithm, including an efficient GPU implementation that alleviates the main bottleneck for large datasets. The performance of the method is evaluated on three examples: an artificial \"toy\" dataset and two whole-cortex instances using data from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas.

This study introduces an empirical method to examine the dynamic functional dysconnectivity in patients with schizophrenia. Temporal brain networks were estimated from resting-state fMRI of 2 independent datasets (patients/controls = 18/19 and 53/57 for self-recorded dataset and a publicly available replication dataset, respectively) by the correlation of sliding time-windowed time courses among regions of a predefined atlas. Through the newly introduced temporal efficiency approach and temporal random network models, we examined, for the first time, the 3D spatiotemporal architecture of the temporal brain network. We found that although prominent temporal small-world properties were revealed in both groups, temporal brain networks of patients with schizophrenia in both datasets showed a significantly higher temporal global efficiency, which cannot be simply attributable to head motion and sampling error. Specifically, we found localized changes of temporal nodal properties in the left frontal, right medial parietal, and subcortical areas that were associated with clinical features of schizophrenia. Our findings demonstrate that altered dynamic FC may underlie abnormal brain function and clinical symptoms observed in schizophrenia.

Temporal brain networks were estimated from resting-state fMRI of 2 independent datasets (patients/controls = 18/19 and 53/57 for self-recorded dataset and a publicly available replication dataset, respectively) by the correlation of sliding time-windowed time courses among regions of a predefined atlas.

We found that although prominent temporal small-world properties were revealed in both groups, temporal brain networks of patients with schizophrenia in both datasets showed a significantly higher temporal global efficiency, which cannot be simply attributable to head motion and sampling error. Specifically, we found localized changes of temporal nodal properties in the left frontal, right medial parietal, and subcortical areas that were associated with clinical features of schizophrenia.

In contrast, local degree disruption differentiates between chronic pain conditions. We used resting-state functional MRI data to analyze the brain connectome at varying scales and densities. In three chronic pain conditions, we observe disrupted kD, in proportion to individuals' pain intensity, and associated with community membership disruption. Additionally, we observe regional degree changes, some of which were unique to each type of chronic pain. Subjects with recent onset of back pain exhibited emergence of kD only when the pain became chronic. Similarly, in neuropathic rats kD emerged weeks after injury, in proportion to pain-like behavior. Thus, we found comprehensive cross-species evidence for chronic pain being a state of global randomization of functional connectivity.\",\n",
       "  'output': 'Chronic pain is a condition that is not well understood, but it is associated with changes in the nervous system. Researchers have found that a measure of functional connectivity called kD can identify chronic pain. This measure looks at how disrupted the connections are in the brain. They found that people with chronic pain had more disrupted connections than those without chronic pain. They also found that different types of chronic pain had different patterns of disrupted connections. This research was done using brain scans of people and rats with chronic pain. Overall, chronic pain seems to be a condition where the connections in the brain become more random.'},\n",

A group of thirty-two patients with the first-episode schizophrenia and comparable healthy controls underwent resting-state qEEG and cognitive assessment. Phase Lag Index (PLI) was applied as a connectivity index and the synchronizations were analyzed in six frequencies. Pairs of electrodes were grouped to separately cover frontal, temporal, central, parietal and occipital regions. PLI was calculated for intra-regional connectivity and between-regions connectivity. Computer version processing speed tests were applied to control for possible fluctuations in cognitive efficiency during the performance of the tasks. In the group of patients, in comparison to healthy controls, significantly higher PLI values were recorded in theta frequency, especially in the posterior areas and decreased PLI in low-alpha frequency within the frontal regions. Mean PLI in gamma frequency was also lower in the patients group. Regression analysis showed that lower intra-regional PLI for left frontal cortex and higher PLI within somatosensory cortex in theta band, together with the duration of untreated psychosis, proved to be significant predictors of impaired processing speed in first-episode patients.

A key feature of these systems is that visual stimuli are often presented within the same workspace as the hands (i.e., peripersonal space). Integrating video-based remote eye tracking with robotic and virtual-reality systems can provide an additional tool for investigating how cognitive processes influence visuomotor learning and rehabilitation of the upper extremity.

Here, we used immersive virtual reality to explore whether mere observation of visual discontinuity between the hand and limb of an avatar could influence a person's sense of ownership of the virtual body (feeling of ownership, FO) and being the agent of its actions (vicarious agency, VA). In experiment 1, we tested whether placing different amounts of visual discontinuity between a virtual hand and limb differently modulate the perceived FO and VA. Participants passively observed from a first-person perspective four different versions of a virtual limb: (1) a full limb; a hand detached from the proximal part of the limb because of deletion of (2) the wrist; (3) the wrist and forearm; (4) and the wrist, forearm and elbow. After observing the static or moving virtual limb, participants reported their feeling of ownership (FO) and vicarious agency (VA) over the hand. We found that even a small visual discontinuity between the virtual hand and arm significantly decreased participants' FO over the hand during observation of the static limb. Moreover, in the same condition, we found that passive observation of the avatar's actions induced a decrease in both FO and VA. We replicated the same results in a second study (experiment 2) where we investigated the modulation of FO and VA by comparing the visual body discontinuity with a condition in which the virtual limb was partially occluded. Our data show that mere observation of limb discontinuity can change a person's ownership and agency over a virtual body observed from a first-person perspective, even in the absence of any multisensory stimulation of the real body.

The activating episodes, that are comprised of three cues (ambush, mortar blasting and waiting for injured rescue), are repeated 3 times each session. The cues' intensity and frequency increase from session to session. Patients are exposed to the VR world through a HMD (Head Mounted Display). This paper reports on the ongoing research where 4 VRET patients that filled CAPS DSM-IV PTSD criteria were assessed at pretreatment and at the middle of treatment (5th session). Results from IES and SCL-90R dimensions showed no statistical significant differences between assessments, with exception to obsession-compulsion dimension of SCL-90R (F(1;3)=21.235; p<.05), indicating a decrease in obsessive thoughts. However, through descriptive analysis, it was observed a reduction in all IES and SCL-90R dimensions, except for hostility and psychoticism of SCL-90R.\",\n",

       "  'input': \"Timing and correction of stepping movements with a virtual reality avatar.\\nResearch into the ability to coordinate one's movements with external cues has focussed on the use of simple rhythmic, auditory and visual stimuli, or interpersonal coordination with another person. Coordinating movements with a virtual avatar has not been explored, in the context of responses to temporal cues. To determine whether cueing of movements using a virtual avatar is effective, people's ability to accurately coordinate with the stimuli needs to be investigated. Here we focus on temporal cues, as we know from timing studies that visual cues can be difficult to follow in the timing context. Real stepping movements were mapped onto an avatar using motion capture data. Healthy participants were then motion captured whilst stepping in time with the avatar's movements, as viewed through a virtual reality headset. The timing of one of the avatar step cycles was accelerated or decelerated by 15% to create a temporal perturbation, for which participants would need to correct to, in order to remain in time. Step onset times of participants relative to the corresponding step-onsets of the avatar were used to measure the timing errors (asynchronies) between them. Participants completed either a visual-only condition, or auditory-visual with footstep sounds included, at two stepping tempo conditions (Fast: 400ms interval, Slow: 800ms interval). Participants' asynchronies exhibited slow drift in the Visual-Only condition, but became stable in the Auditory-Visual condition. Moreover, we observed a clear corrective response to the phase perturbation in both the fast and slow tempo auditory-visual conditions. We conclude that an avatar's movements can be used to influence a person's own motion, but should include relevant auditory cues congruent with the movement to ensure a suitable level of entrainment is achieved. This approach has applications in physiotherapy, where virtual avatars present an opportunity to provide the guidance to assist patients in adhering to prescribed exercises.\",\n",

There are, however, some barriers to adoption that must be addressed, such as that of motion sickness - which can lead to undesirable symptoms including postural instability, headaches, and nausea. Motion sickness in virtual reality occurs as a result of moving visual stimuli that cause users to perceive self-motion while they remain stationary in the real world.

It has become popular in recent years because it allows medical professionals to practice procedures without putting real patients at risk. In the field of Otolaryngology, simulation is used to teach a range of skills, from simple procedures to complex surgeries.\\n\\nOne of the main benefits of simulation is that it allows learners to practice in a safe and controlled environment. This is particularly important in Otolaryngology, where procedures can be complex and delicate. Simulation also allows learners to repeat procedures until they feel confident and competent, without the risk of harming a real patient.\\n\\nThere is some evidence to suggest that simulation can improve outcomes for patients and learners. For example, a study published in the Journal of Surgical Education found that residents who trained on a virtual reality simulator for temporal bone surgery had better surgical skills than those who did not. However, more research is needed to fully understand the impact of simulation on patient outcomes.\\n\\nDespite the lack of robust evidence, simulation is becoming increasingly popular in Otolaryngology. This is partly due to the shortage of cadaveric material, which has traditionally been used for surgical training. Simulation also allows learners to practice procedures that are rare or difficult to perform in real life.\\n\\nOverall, simulation is a promising tool for teaching Otolaryngology skills.

       "  'output': 'Adding trees and moving water can improve the quality of outdoor spaces exposed to aircraft noise, according to a study. The research found that the presence of vegetation and water features significantly improved the soundscape quality, particularly when both were present. Moving water also reduced the prominence of aircraft noise, changing the balance of foreground and background sounds. The study suggests that incorporating soundscape strategies could complement noise abatement measures in areas affected by aircraft noise.'},\n",

       "  'input': 'An Auti-Sim Intervention: The Role of Perspective Taking in Combating Public Stigma with Virtual Simulations.\\nPublic stigma associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) commonly stems from judgments surrounding sensory overload symptoms. As individuals try and make sense of observed disordered behaviors of those with ASD, they are quick to develop dispositional attributions instead of acknowledging situational instigators. Interventions aimed at educating the lay public that disordered actions are a result of a biological causes have been successful in lessening perceptions of responsibility, yet foster an out-group perspective allowing prejudice attitudes and discriminatory behaviors to persist. The present study examines the short-term effectiveness of engagement with a virtual simulation, Auti-Sim, to combat stigma by giving lay people a first-person experience of sensory overload. To assess Auti-Sim, a between-subject, in-laboratory experimental design was employed. A total of 123 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 interventions (virtual simulation engagement, observation of simulation engagement, or reading text vignettes). Participants completed a brief pretest questionnaire, encountered the intervention, and then completed a post-test questionnaire. Engagement with the virtual simulation resulted in heightened perspective taking, which subsequently increased emotional concern, helping intentions, and willingness to volunteer compared with the observation only or text vignette intervention. Positive attitudes toward those with ASD did not differ across interventions. Fostering a different understanding of disordered action through a virtual simulation has the potential to elicit perspective taking and subsequent empathetic outcomes. Perspective taking seems to encourage perceptions of in-group belonging rather than out-group categorization and thus might be a desired outcome for stigma-reducing efforts.',\n",
