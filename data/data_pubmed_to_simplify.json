   "Adaptive Learning Algorithm Convergence in Passive and Reactive Environments.\nAlthough the number of artificial neural network and machine learning architectures is growing at an exponential pace, more attention needs to be paid to theoretical guarantees of asymptotic convergence for novel, nonlinear, high-dimensional adaptive learning algorithms. When properly understood, such guarantees can guide the algorithm development and evaluation process and provide theoretical validation for a particular algorithm design. For many decades, the machine learning community has widely recognized the importance of stochastic approximation theory as a powerful tool for identifying explicit convergence conditions for adaptive learning machines. However, the verification of such conditions is challenging for multidisciplinary researchers not working in the area of stochastic approximation theory. For this reason, this letter presents a new stochastic approximation theorem for both passive and reactive learning environments with assumptions that are easily verifiable. The theorem is widely applicable to the analysis and design of important machine learning algorithms including deep learning algorithms with multiple strict local minimizers, Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithms, contrastive divergence learning in Markov fields, and policy gradient reinforcement learning.",
   "Deep learning detection and quantification of pneumothorax in heterogeneous routine chest computed tomography.\nAutomatically detecting and quantifying pneumothorax on chest computed tomography (CT) may impact clinical decision-making. Machine learning methods published so far struggle with the heterogeneity of technical parameters and the presence of additional pathologies, highlighting the importance of stable algorithms.",
   "Autonomous illumination control for localization microscopy.\nSuper-resolution fluorescence microscopy improves spatial resolution, but this comes at a loss of image throughput and presents unique challenges in identifying optimal acquisition parameters. Microscope automation routines can offset these drawbacks, but thus far have required user inputs that presume a priori knowledge about the sample. Here, we develop a flexible illumination control system for localization microscopy comprised of two interacting components that require no sample-specific inputs: a self-tuning controller and a deep learning-based molecule density estimator that is accurate over an extended range of densities. This system obviates the need to fine-tune parameters and enables robust, autonomous illumination control for localization microscopy.",
   "Ultra-Low-Dose 18F-Florbetaben Amyloid PET Imaging Using Deep Learning with Multi-Contrast MRI Inputs.\nPurpose To reduce radiotracer requirements for amyloid PET/MRI without sacrificing diagnostic quality by using deep learning methods. Materials and Methods Forty data sets from 39 patients (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation [SD], 67 years \u00b1 8), including 16 male patients and 23 female patients (mean age, 66 years \u00b1 6 and 68 years \u00b1 9, respectively), who underwent simultaneous amyloid (fluorine 18 [18F]-florbetaben) PET/MRI examinations were acquired from March 2016 through October 2017 and retrospectively analyzed. One hundredth of the raw list-mode PET data were randomly chosen to simulate a low-dose (1%) acquisition. Convolutional neural networks were implemented with low-dose PET and multiple MR images (PET-plus-MR model) or with low-dose PET alone (PET-only) as inputs to predict full-dose PET images. Quality of the synthesized images was evaluated while Bland-Altman plots assessed the agreement of regional standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) between image types. Two readers scored image quality on a five-point scale (5 = excellent) and determined amyloid status (positive or negative). Statistical analyses were carried out to assess the difference of image quality metrics and reader agreement and to determine confidence intervals (CIs) for reading results. Results The synthesized images (especially from the PET-plus-MR model) showed marked improvement on all quality metrics compared with the low-dose image. All PET-plus-MR images scored 3 or higher, with proportions of images rated greater than 3 similar to those for the full-dose images (-10% difference [eight of 80 readings], 95% CI: -15%, -5%). Accuracy for amyloid status was high (71 of 80 readings [89%]) and similar to intrareader reproducibility of full-dose images (73 of 80 [91%]). The PET-plus-MR model also had the smallest mean and variance for SUVR difference to full-dose images. Conclusion Simultaneously acquired MRI and ultra-low-dose PET data can be used to synthesize full-dose-like amyloid PET images. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

   "Detecting abnormal electroencephalograms using deep convolutional networks.\nElectroencephalography (EEG) is a central part of the medical evaluation for patients with neurological disorders. Training an algorithm to label the EEG normal vs abnormal seems challenging, because of EEG heterogeneity and dependence of contextual factors, including age and sleep stage. Our objectives were to validate prior work on an independent data set suggesting that deep learning methods can discriminate between normal vs abnormal EEGs, to understand whether age and sleep stage information can improve discrimination, and to understand what factors lead to errors.",
   "Deep learning for clustering of multivariate clinical patient trajectories with missing values.\nPrecision medicine requires a stratification of patients by disease presentation that is sufficiently informative to allow for selecting treatments on a per-patient basis. For many diseases, such as neurological disorders, this stratification problem translates into a complex problem of clustering multivariate and relatively short time series because (i) these diseases are multifactorial and not well described by single clinical outcome variables and (ii) disease progression needs to be monitored over time. Additionally, clinical data often additionally are hindered by the presence of many missing values, further complicating any clustering attempts.",

   "The effect of surgeon's learning curve: complications and outcome after hip arthroscopy.\nThe aim of the present study was to determine the incidence and type of complications during and after hip arthroscopy as well as the effect of the surgeon's learning curve on the occurrence of complications. We expect that the currently reported prevalence especially of minor complications is likely to be underreported in most retrospective series based on chart analysis.",
   "Identification of Patients in Need of Advanced Care for Depression Using Data Extracted From a Statewide Health Information Exchange: A Machine Learning Approach.\nAs the most commonly occurring form of mental illness worldwide, depression poses significant health and economic burdens to both the individual and community. Different types of depression pose different levels of risk. Individuals who suffer from mild forms of depression may recover without any assistance or be effectively managed by primary care or family practitioners. However, other forms of depression are far more severe and require advanced care by certified mental health providers. However, identifying cases of depression that require advanced care may be challenging to primary care providers and health care team members whose skill sets run broad rather than deep.",
   "On the Effectiveness of Deep Representation Learning: the Atrial Fibrillation Case.\nThe automatic and unsupervised analysis of biomedical time series is of primary importance for diagnostic and preventive medicine, enabling fast and reliable data processing to reveal clinical insights without the need for human intervention. Representation learning (RL) methods perform an automatic extraction of meaningful features that can be used, e.g., for a subsequent classification of the measured data. The goal of this study is to explore and quantify the benefits of RL techniques of varying degrees of complexity, focusing on modern deep learning (DL) architectures. We focus on the automatic classification of atrial fibrillation (AF) events from noisy single-lead electrocardiographic signals (ECG) obtained from wireless sensors. This is an important task as it allows the detection of sub-clinical AF which is hard to diagnose with a short in-clinic 12-lead ECG. The effectiveness of the considered architectures is quantified and discussed in terms of classification performance, memory/data efficiency and computational complexity.",
   "FAST AND EFFICIENT REJECTION OF BACKGROUND WAVEFORMS IN INTERICTAL EEG.\nAutomated annotation of electroencephalograms (EEG) of epileptic patients is important in diagnosis and management of epilepsy. Epilepsy is often associated with the presence of epileptiform transients (ET) in the EEG. To develop an efficient ET detector, a vast amount of data is required to train and evaluate the performance of the detector. Interictal EEG data contains mostly background waveforms, since ETs only occur occasionally in most patients. In order to detect ETs in an automated fashion, it is meaningful to first try to eliminate most background waveforms by means of simple, fast classifiers. The remaining waveforms can in a following step be processed by more sophisticated and computationally demanding classification algorithms, such as deep learning systems. In this study, we design a cascade of simple thresholding steps to reject most background waveforms in interictal EEG, while maintaining most ETs. Several simple and quick-to-compute EEG features are chosen. By thresholding these features in consecutive steps, background waveforms are rejected sequentially. In our numerical experiments, a cascade of 10 steps is able to reject 98.65% of all background segments in the dataset, while preserving 90.6% of the ETs.",
   "Auditory-cued sensorimotor task reveals disengagement deficits in rats exposed to the autism-associated teratogen valproic acid.\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is often found to co-exist with non-core behavioral manifestations that include difficulties in disengagement of attention to sensory cues. Here we examined whether this behavioral abnormality can be induced in rats prenatally exposed to valproic acid (VPA), a well-established teratogen associated with ASD animal models. We tested rats using an auditory-cued sensorimotor task (ACST) based on the premise that ACST will be more sensitive to developmental changes in temporal association cortex (TeA) of the posterior attention system. We show that VPA rats learned the ACST markedly faster than control animals, but they exhibited a profound preoccupation with cues associated with the expectancy at the reward location such that disengagement was disrupted. Control rats on the other hand were able to disengage and utilize auditory cues for re-engagement. However, both control and VPA-treated rats performed similarly when tested on novel object recognition (NOR) and novel context mismatch (NOCM) behavioral tasks that are known to be sensitive to normal perirhinal and prefrontal network functioning respectively. Consistent with disrupted posterior rather than frontal networks, we also report that VPA can selectively act on deep-layer TeA cortical neurons by showing that VPA increased dendritic density in isolated deep-layer TeA but not frontal neurons. These results describe a useful approach to examine the role of cue-dependent control of attention systems in rodent models of autism and suggest that disengagement impairments may arise from an inability to modify behavior through the appropriate use of sensory cue associations.",
   "Approaches to learning: psychometric testing of a study process questionnaire.\nOne method of evaluating students' learning is to measure surface, deep and achieving approaches to learning using a questionnaire. In comparison with research on student nurses' learning styles, there has been little examination of their 'approaches to learning'. Much of the 'approaches to learning' research has been conducted with higher education students in Australia and Hong Kong and this kind of measurement is viewed as a valid and reliable way to assess learning.",
   "Reaching the End-Game for GWAS: Machine Learning Approaches for the Prioritization of Complex Disease Loci.\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed thousands of genetic loci that underpin the complex biology of many human traits. However, the strength of GWAS - the ability to detect genetic association by linkage disequilibrium (LD) - is also its limitation. Whilst the ever-increasing study size and improved design have augmented the power of GWAS to detect effects, differentiation of causal variants or genes from other highly correlated genes associated by LD remains the real challenge. This has severely hindered the biological insights and clinical translation of GWAS findings. Although thousands of disease susceptibility loci have been reported, causal genes at these loci remain elusive. Machine learning (ML) techniques offer an opportunity to dissect the heterogeneity of variant and gene signals in the post-GWAS analysis phase. ML models for GWAS prioritization vary greatly in their complexity, ranging from relatively simple logistic regression approaches to more complex ensemble models such as random forests and gradient boosting, as well as deep learning models, i.e., neural networks. Paired with functional validation, these methods show important promise for clinical translation, providing a strong evidence-based approach to direct post-GWAS research. However, as ML approaches continue to evolve to meet the challenge of causal gene identification, a critical assessment of the underlying methodologies and their applicability to the GWAS prioritization problem is needed. This review investigates the landscape of ML applications in three parts: selected models, input features, and output model performance, with a focus on prioritizations of complex disease associated loci. Overall, we explore the contributions ML has made towards reaching the GWAS end-game with consequent wide-ranging translational impact.",
   "Whole slide imaging system using deep learning-based automated focusing.\nThe auto focusing system, which involves moving a microscope stage along a vertical axis to find an optimal focus position, is the chief component of an automated digital microscope. Current automated focusing algorithms, especially those deployed in cost effective microscopy systems, often cannot match the efficiency of a skilled human operator in keeping a sample in focus. This work presents an auto focusing system that utilises the recent advances in machine learning, namely deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). It improves upon prior work in this domain. The results of the focusing algorithm are demonstrated on an open data set. We describe the practical implementation of this method on a low cost digital microscope to create a whole slide imaging system (WSI). Results of a clinical study using this WSI system are presented. The study demonstrates the efficacy of this system in a practical scenario.",
   "Environmental factors and nutritional status of rural children.\nThe nutritional status of school-aged children is a growing concern of health care professionals today. In collaboration with a Kellogg Project in the deep south, students from a large university school of nursing participated in a project to improve the nutritional status of rural school-aged children. The project goals focused on educating thd children about the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Guide Pyramid, reading nutritional labels and recognizing foods with high fat content, and the importance of exercise along with diet. The nursing students created a nutritional assessment tool to use with each child to determine their educational needs. The project involved lecture, interactive class discussion, and hands-on activities. Information from the assessment tool revealed that fast food and foods high in fat were the most popular with the children. After project completion, the posttest revealed an increase in cognitive knowledge of nutrition among all the children. In addition to this positive learning experience for the children, improving the health status of children in the community was an excellent educational opportunity for the nursing students.",
   "Contact air abrasion.\nThe advantages of contact air abrasion techniques are readily apparent. The first, of course, is the greatly increased ease of use. Working with contact also tends to speed the learning curve by giving the process a more natural dental feel. In addition, as one becomes familiar with working with a dust stream, the potential for misdirecting the air flow is decreased. The future use of air abrasion for deep decay removal will make this the treatment of choice for the next millennium.",
   "The case for testing memory with both stories and word lists prior to dbs surgery for Parkinson's Disease.\nPatients seeking deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery for Parkinson's disease (PD) typically undergo neuropsychological assessment to determine candidacy for surgery, with poor memory performance interpreted as a contraindication. Patients with PD may exhibit worse memory for word lists than for stories due to the lack of inherent organization in a list of unrelated words. Unfortunately, word list and story tasks are typically developed from different normative datasets, and the existence of a memory performance discrepancy in PD has been challenged. We compared recall of stories and word lists in 35 non-demented PD candidates for DBS. We administered commonly used neuropsychological measures of word list and story memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, Logical Memory), along with a second word list task that was co-normed with the story task. Age-corrected scores were higher for the story task than for both word list tasks. Compared to story recall, word list recall correlated more consistently with motor severity and composite measures of processing speed, working memory, and executive functioning. These results support the classic view of fronto-subcortical contributions to memory in PD and suggest that executive deficits may influence word list recall more than story recall. We recommend a multi-componential memory battery in the neuropsychological assessment of DBS candidates to characterize both mesial temporal and frontal-executive memory processes. One should not rely solely on a word list task because patients exhibiting poor memory for word lists may perform better with stories and therefore deserve an interdisciplinary discussion for DBS surgery.",
   "Artificial intelligence as an emerging technology in the current care of neurological disorders.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has influenced all aspects of human life and neurology is no exception to this growing trend. The aim of this paper is to guide medical practitioners on the relevant aspects of artificial intelligence, i.e., machine learning, and deep learning, to review the development of technological advancement equipped with AI, and to elucidate how machine learning can revolutionize the management of neurological diseases. This review focuses on unsupervised aspects of machine learning, and how these aspects could be applied to precision neurology to improve patient outcomes. We have mentioned various forms of available AI, prior research, outcomes, benefits and limitations of AI, effective accessibility and future of AI, keeping the current burden of neurological disorders in mind.",
   "A deep learning based fusion of RGB camera information and magnetic localization information for endoscopic capsule robots.\nA reliable, real time localization functionality is crutial for actively controlled capsule endoscopy robots, which are an emerging, minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic technology for the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In this study, we extend the success of deep learning approaches from various research fields to the problem of sensor fusion for endoscopic capsule robots. We propose a multi-sensor fusion based localization approach which combines endoscopic camera information and magnetic sensor based localization information. The results performed on real pig stomach dataset show that our method achieves sub-millimeter precision for both translational and rotational movements.",
   "A Deep Neural Network for Identifying DNA N4-Methylcytosine Sites.\nMotivation: N4-methylcytosine (4mC) plays an important role in host defense and transcriptional regulation. Accurate identification of 4mc sites provides a more comprehensive understanding of its biological effects. At present, the traditional machine learning algorithms are used in the research on 4mC sites prediction, but the complexity of the algorithms is relatively high, which is not suitable for the processing of large data sets, and the accuracy of prediction needs to be improved. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new and effective method to accurately identify 4mC sites. Results: In this work, we found a large number of 4mC sites and non 4mC sites of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) from the latest MethSMRT website, which greatly expanded the dataset of C. elegans, and developed a hybrid deep neural network framework named 4mcDeep-CBI, aiming to identify 4mC sites. In order to obtain the high latitude information of the feature, we input the preliminary extracted features into the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory network (BLSTM) to generate advanced features. Taking the advanced features as algorithm input, we have proposed an integrated algorithm to improve feature representation. Experimental results on large new dataset show that the proposed predictor is able to achieve generally better performance in identifying 4mC sites as compared to the state-of-art predictor. Notably, this is the first study of identifying 4mC sites using deep neural network. Moreover, our model runs much faster than the state-of-art predictor.",

   "MoDL-MUSSELS: Model-Based Deep Learning for Multishot Sensitivity-Encoded Diffusion MRI.\nWe introduce a model-based deep learning architecture termed MoDL-MUSSELS for the correction of phase errors in multishot diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR images. The proposed algorithm is a generalization of the existing MUSSELS algorithm with similar performance but significantly reduced computational complexity. In this work, we show that an iterative re-weighted least-squares implementation of MUSSELS alternates between a multichannel filter bank and the enforcement of data consistency. The multichannel filter bank projects the data to the signal subspace, thus exploiting the annihilation relations between shots. Due to the high computational complexity of the self-learned filter bank, we propose replacing it with a convolutional neural network (CNN) whose parameters are learned from exemplary data. The proposed CNN is a hybrid model involving a multichannel CNN in the k-space and another CNN in the image space. The k-space CNN exploits the annihilation relations between the shot images, while the image domain network is used to project the data to an image manifold. The experiments show that the proposed scheme can yield reconstructions that are comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering several orders of magnitude reduction in run-time.",
   "Causal reasoning versus associative learning: A useful dichotomy or a strawman battle in comparative psychology?\nThe debate about whether or not one could/should ascribe reasoning abilities to animals has deep historical roots and seems very up-to-date in the light of the immense body of new empirical data originating from various species and research paradigms. Associative learning (AL) seems to be a ubiquitous low-level contender for any cognitive interpretation of animal behavior, mostly because of the assumed mechanistic simplicity and phylogenetic prevalence. However, the implicit assumption that AL is simple and therefore the most parsimonious mechanism to describe seemingly complex behavior can and must be questioned on various grounds. Using recent empirical findings with chimpanzees as an example, I argue that at times inferential reasoning might be the most likely candidate to account for performance differences between experimental and control conditions. Finally, a general conclusion drawn from the current debate(s) in the field of comparative psychology could be that a dichotomist battle of 2 conceptual camps-each of which is lacking a clear and homogeneous theoretical framework-is a scientific deadlock.

   "The spacing principle for unlearning abnormal neuronal synchrony.\nDesynchronizing stimulation techniques were developed to specifically counteract abnormal neuronal synchronization relevant to several neurological and psychiatric disorders. The goal of our approach is to achieve an anti-kindling, where the affected neural networks unlearn abnormal synaptic connectivity and, hence, abnormal neuronal synchrony, by means of desynchronizing stimulation, in particular, Coordinated Reset (CR) stimulation. As known from neuroscience, psychology and education, learning effects can be enhanced by means of the spacing principle, i.e. by delivering repeated stimuli spaced by pauses as opposed to delivering a massed stimulus (in a single long stimulation session). To illustrate that the spacing principle may boost the anti-kindling effect of CR neuromodulation, in this computational study we carry this approach to extremes. To this end, we deliver spaced CR neuromodulation at particularly weak intensities which render permanently delivered CR neuromodulation ineffective. Intriguingly, spaced CR neuromodulation at these particularly weak intensities effectively induces an anti-kindling. In fact, the spacing principle enables the neuronal population to successively hop from one attractor to another one, finally approaching attractors characterized by down-regulated synaptic connectivity and synchrony. Our computational results might open up novel opportunities to effectively induce sustained desynchronization at particularly weak stimulation intensities, thereby avoiding side effects, e.g., in the case of deep brain stimulation.",
   "Emergence of a 'visual number sense' in hierarchical generative models.\nNumerosity estimation is phylogenetically ancient and foundational to human mathematical learning, but its computational bases remain controversial. Here we show that visual numerosity emerges as a statistical property of images in 'deep networks' that learn a hierarchical generative model of the sensory input. Emergent numerosity detectors had response profiles resembling those of monkey parietal neurons and supported numerosity estimation with the same behavioral signature shown by humans and animals.",

   "An End-to-End Learning Framework for Video Compression.\nTraditional video compression approaches build upon the hybrid coding framework with motion-compensated prediction and residual transform coding. In this paper, taking advantage of both the classical compression architecture and the powerful non-linear representation ability of neural networks, we propose the first end-to-end deep video compression framework. Our framework employs pixel-wise motion information, which is learned from an optical flow network and further compressed by an auto-encoder network to save bits. The other compression components are also implemented by well-designed networks for high efficiency. All the modules are jointly optimized by using the rate-distortion trade-off and collaborate with each other. More importantly, the proposed deep video compression framework is very flexible and can be easily extended by using lightweight or advanced networks for higher speed or better efficiency. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can outperform the widely used video coding standard H.264 and be even on par with the latest standard H.265.",
   "DeepScreening: a deep learning-based screening web server for accelerating drug discovery.\nDeep learning contributes significantly to researches in biological sciences and drug discovery. Previous studies suggested that deep learning techniques have shown superior performance to other machine learning algorithms in virtual screening, which is a critical step to accelerate the drug discovery. However, the application of deep learning techniques in drug discovery and chemical biology are hindered due to the data availability, data further processing and lacking of the user-friendly deep learning tools and interface. Therefore, we developed a user-friendly web server with integration of the state of art deep learning algorithm, which utilizes either the public or user-provided dataset to help biologists or chemists perform virtual screening either the chemical probes or drugs for a specific target of interest. With DeepScreening, user could conveniently construct a deep learning model and generate the target-focused de novo libraries. The constructed classification and regression models could be subsequently used for virtual screening against the generated de novo libraries, or diverse chemical libraries in stock. From deep models training to virtual screening, and target focused de novo library generation, all those tasks could be finished with DeepScreening. We believe this deep learning-based web server will benefit to both biologists and chemists for probes or drugs discovery.",
   "Beyond 'faith-based medicine' and EBM.\nLongstanding debate on evidence-based medicine (EBM) may have reached a critical saturation point. I briefly report on systematic reviews on the recurring themes in the critical literature. In this context, some criticisms to EBM are substantial and enduring, although convincing arguments to contrast unresolved issues have yet to be produced. Nonetheless, few changes have been adopted and conservative attitudes persist in EBM. Despite its 'success', implementation in practice has been inexorably overshadowed leading to paradoxical shortcomings. This controversial scenario offers a formidable occasion to gain needed insight. The aim of this paper is to attempt a comprehensive analysis by reframing a number of key concerns, while furnishing pragmatic, interdisciplinary solutions for these deep-rooted dilemmas. In the interests of all stakeholders, I seek to promote a concerted effort to resolve conflict and build consensus.",
   "Two subdivisions of macaque LIP process visual-oculomotor information differently.\nAlthough the cerebral cortex is thought to be composed of functionally distinct areas, the actual parcellation of area and assignment of function are still highly controversial. An example is the much-studied lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP). Despite the general agreement that LIP plays an important role in visual-oculomotor transformation, it remains unclear whether the area is primary sensory- or motor-related (the attention-intention debate). Although LIP has been considered as a functionally unitary area, its dorsal (LIPd) and ventral (LIPv) parts differ in local morphology and long-distance connectivity. In particular, LIPv has much stronger connections with two oculomotor centers, the frontal eye field and the deep layers of the superior colliculus, than does LIPd. Such anatomical distinctions imply that compared with LIPd, LIPv might be more involved in oculomotor processing. We tested this hypothesis physiologically with a memory saccade task and a gap saccade task. We found that LIP neurons with persistent memory activities in memory saccade are primarily provoked either by visual stimulation (vision-related) or by both visual and saccadic events (vision-saccade-related) in gap saccade. The distribution changes from predominantly vision-related to predominantly vision-saccade-related as the recording depth increases along the dorsal-ventral dimension. Consistently, the simultaneously recorded local field potential also changes from visual evoked to saccade evoked. Finally, local injection of muscimol (GABA agonist) in LIPv, but not in LIPd, dramatically decreases the proportion of express saccades. With these results, we conclude that LIPd and LIPv are more involved in visual and visual-saccadic processing, respectively.",
   "Segregated fronto-cortical and midbrain connections in the mouse and their relation to approach and avoidance orienting behaviors.\nThe orchestration of orienting behaviors requires the interaction of many cortical and subcortical areas, for example the superior colliculus (SC), as well as prefrontal areas responsible for top-down control. Orienting involves different behaviors, such as approach and avoidance. In the rat, these behaviors are at least partially mapped onto different SC subdomains, the lateral (SCl) and medial (SCm), respectively. To delineate the circuitry involved in the two types of orienting behavior in mice, we injected retrograde tracer into the intermediate and deep layers of the SCm and SCl, and thereby determined the main input structures to these subdomains. Overall the SCm receives larger numbers of afferents compared to the SCl. The prefrontal cingulate area (Cg), visual, oculomotor, and auditory areas provide strong input to the SCm, while prefrontal motor area 2 (M2), and somatosensory areas provide strong input to the SCl. The prefrontal areas Cg and M2 in turn connect to different cortical and subcortical areas, as determined by anterograde tract tracing. Even though connectivity pattern often overlap, our labeling approaches identified segregated neural circuits involving SCm, Cg, secondary visual cortices, auditory areas, and the dysgranular retrospenial cortex likely to be involved in avoidance behaviors. Conversely, SCl, M2, somatosensory cortex, and the granular retrospenial cortex comprise a network likely involved in approach/appetitive behaviors.",
   "PWStableNet: Learning Pixel-wise Warping Maps for Video Stabilization.\nAs the videos captured by hand-held cameras are often perturbed by high-frequency jitters, stabilization of these videos is an essential task. Many video stabilization methods have been proposed to stabilize shaky videos. However, most methods estimate one global homography or several homographies based on fixed meshes to warp the shaky frames into their stabilized views. Due to the existence of parallax, such single or a few homographies can not well handle the depth variation. In contrast to these traditional methods, we propose a novel video stabilization network, called PWStableNet, which comes up pixel-wise warping maps, i.e., potentially different warping for different pixels, and stabilizes each pixel to its stabilized view. To our best knowledge, this is the first deep learning based pixel-wise video stabilization. The proposed method is built upon a multi-stage cascade encoder-decoder architecture and learns pixel-wise warping maps from consecutive unstable frames. Inter-stage connections are also introduced to add feature maps of a former stage to the corresponding feature maps at a latter stage, which enables the latter stage to learn the residual from the feature maps of former stages. This cascade architecture can produce more precise warping maps at latter stages. To ensure the correct learning of pixel-wise warping maps, we use a well-designed loss function to guide the training procedure of the proposed PWStableNet. The proposed stabilization method achieves comparable performance with traditional methods, but stronger robustness and much faster processing speed. Moreover, the proposed stabilization method outperforms some typical CNN-based stabilization methods, especially in videos with strong parallax. Codes will be provided at https://github.com/mindazhao/pix-pix-warping-video-stabilization.",
   "Derivation and Validation of Machine Learning Approaches to Predict Acute Kidney Injury after Cardiac Surgery.\nMachine learning approaches were introduced for better or comparable predictive ability than statistical analysis to predict postoperative outcomes. We sought to compare the performance of machine learning approaches with that of logistic regression analysis to predict acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery. We retrospectively reviewed 2010 patients who underwent open heart surgery and thoracic aortic surgery. Baseline medical condition, intraoperative anesthesia, and surgery-related data were obtained. The primary outcome was postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria. The following machine learning techniques were used: decision tree, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, support vector machine, neural network classifier, and deep learning. The performance of these techniques was compared with that of logistic regression analysis regarding the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). During the first postoperative week, AKI occurred in 770 patients (38.3%). The best performance regarding AUC was achieved by the gradient boosting machine to predict the AKI of all stages (0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75\u207b0.80) or stage 2 or 3 AKI. The AUC of logistic regression analysis was 0.69 (95% CI 0.66\u207b0.72). Decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine showed similar performance to logistic regression. In our comprehensive comparison of machine learning approaches with logistic regression analysis, gradient boosting technique showed the best performance with the highest AUC and lower error rate. We developed an Internet\u207bbased risk estimator which could be used for real-time processing of patient data to estimate the risk of AKI at the end of surgery.",
   "Channel Attention Module with Multi-scale Grid Average Pooling for Breast Cancer Segmentation in an Ultrasound Image.\nBreast cancer accounts for the second-largest number of deaths in women around the world, and more than 8 percent of women will suffer from the disease in their lifetime. Mortality due to breast cancer can be reduced by its early and precise diagnosis. Many studies have investigated methods for segmentation, and computer-aided diagnosis based on deep learning techniques, in particular, have recently gained attention. However, recently proposed methods such as FCN, SegNet and U-Net still need to be further improved to provide better semantic segmentation when diagnosing breast cancer by ultrasound imaging, because of their low performance. In this paper, we propose a channel attention module with multiscale grid average pooling, for the precise segmentation of breast cancer regions in ultrasound images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the channel attention module with multi-scale grid average pooling for semantic segmentation and develop a novel semantic segmentation network with the proposed attention module for precise segmentation of breast cancer regions in ultrasound images. While a conventional convolutional operation cannot use global spatial information on input images and only use the small local information in a kernel of a convolution filter, the proposed attention module allows to use both global and local spatial information. In addition, through ablation studies, we come up with a network architecture for precise breast cancer segmentation in an ultrasound image. The proposed network was constructed with an open source breast cancer ultrasound image dataset, and its performance was compared with those of other state-of-the-art deep-learning models for the segmentation of breast cancer. The experimental results showed that our network outperformed other segmentation methods, and the proposed channel attention module improved the performance of the network for breast cancer segmentation in ultrasound images.",
   "Inferring Drug-Related Diseases Based on Convolutional Neural Network and Gated Recurrent Unit.\nPredicting novel uses for drugs using their chemical, pharmacological, and indication information contributes to minimizing costs and development periods. Most previous prediction methods focused on integrating the similarity and association information of drugs and diseases. However, they tended to construct shallow prediction models to predict drug-associated diseases, which make deeply integrating the information difficult. Further, path information between drugs and diseases is important auxiliary information for association prediction, while it is not deeply integrated. We present a deep learning-based method, CGARDP, for predicting drug-related candidate disease indications. CGARDP establishes a feature matrix by exploiting a variety of biological premises related to drugs and diseases. A novel model based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) is constructed to learn the local and path representations for a drug-disease pair. The CNN-based framework on the left of the model learns the local representation of the drug-disease pair from their feature matrix. As the different paths have discriminative contributions to the drug-disease association prediction, we construct an attention mechanism at the path level to learn the informative paths. In the right part, a GRU-based framework learns the path representation based on path information between the drug and the disease. Cross-validation results indicate that CGARDP performs better than several state-of-the-art methods. Further, CGARDP retrieves more real drug-disease associations in the top part of the prediction result that are of concern to biologists. Case studies on five drugs demonstrate that CGARDP can discover potential drug-related disease indications.",
   "A learned odor decreases the number of Fos-immunopositive granule cells in the olfactory bulb of young rats.\nOlfactory stimulation evokes a column of activity within the olfactory bulb extending from the glomerular layer to the granule cell layer that can be visualized with 2-deoxyglucose autoradiography, optical imaging, Fos protein immunohistochemistry and c-fos mRNA in situ hybridization. The Fos response to odors is typified by the activity of relatively few juxtaglomerular cells, which often occur in foci, and a large number of granule cells extending through much of the bulb. In this study, we characterized the granule cell response to an odor for which young rats had acquired a preference. Fos-like immunoreactive granule cells were quantified by image analysis, and densely stained cells were counted in a region previously shown to be responsive to peppermint odor. We found that odor-trained pups have about half the number of Fos-immunopositive superficial granule cells which respond to a learned odor than do control pups. We then determined whether there was a correlation between the juxtaglomerular cell response and the response of the superficial granule cells deep to those glomerular layer cells. We found a positive correlation between the number of juxtaglomerular cells and the number of granule cells demonstrating Fos immunoreactivity in both control and trained pups, a relationship that changed with early olfactory training.",
   "Medios- An offline, smartphone-based artificial intelligence algorithm for the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy.\nAn observational study to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the Medios smartphone-based offline deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) software to detect diabetic retinopathy (DR) compared with the image diagnosis of ophthalmologists.",
   "Robustness Through Simplicity: A Minimalist Gateway to Neurorobotic Flight.\nIn attempting to build neurorobotic systems based on flying animals, engineers have come to rely on existing firmware and simulation tools designed for miniature aerial vehicles (MAVs). Although they provide a valuable platform for the collection of data for Deep Learning and related AI approaches, such tools are deliberately designed to be general (supporting air, ground, and water vehicles) and feature-rich. The sheer amount of code required to support such broad capabilities can make it a daunting task to adapt these tools to building neurorobotic systems for flight. In this paper we present a complementary pair of simple, object-oriented software tools (multirotor flight-control firmware and simulation platform), each consisting of a core of a few thousand lines of C++ code, that we offer as a candidate solution to this challenge. By providing a minimalist application programming interface (API) for sensors and PID controllers, our software tools make it relatively painless for engineers to prototype neuromorphic approaches to MAV sensing and navigation. We conclude our discussion by presenting a simple PID controller we built using the popular Nengo neural simulator in conjunction with our flight-simulation platform.",
   "[Medical popularization and moral therapy in Plutarch's Treatise de tuenda sanitate praecepta (Ygieina paraggelmata)].\nIn his treatise De tuenda sanitate praecepta (Ygieina paraggelmata: Prescriptions for Health), the Greek philosopher Plutarch of Chaeronea (b. about 45 A.D., d. about 125 A.D.) pursues two aims, which have a deep pedagogical character and are closely connected. To begin with, he would like to provide both his colleagues, \"the philosophers\" (the equivalent of today's \"intellectuals\") and politicians with some sanitary/medical suggestions, so that they may adopt a healthy 'life-style', and consequently avoid disease to the best of their ability. Plutarch thus proposes that \"philosophers\" be made aware of the opportunity, or better yet, of the necessity of learning some medical notions: in their general education (paideia), his colleagues should allow medicine its adequate space, at least in regard to the practical side of the field which relates to a 'life-regimen'. At the same time, Plutarch wishes to impart a moral teaching: in order to remain in good health we must distance ourselves from irrational impulses and social conventions which induce us to practice detrimental behaviours. In this context, the author stresses the need to respect the principles of moderation--both medical and ethical: those of frugality, self-control, and naturalness. His advice is still valid and effective today. Within the background of Plutarch's treatise there is yet a third, implicit aim: to urge the physicians not to imprison themselves in their professional specialization, but rather to also acquire a philosophical education. Such education would indeed allow them to achieve a whole, \"holistic\" picture of man, who is at the same time soul and body. Many diseases could in fact be avoided if everyone would practice on himself a sort of \"moral therapy\", which would prevent the soul from falling prey to those deceptive desires from which \"self-destructive\" behaviours frequently derive.",
   "Motion Blur Kernel Estimation via Deep Learning.\nThe success of the state-of-the-art deblurring methods mainly depends on the restoration of sharp edges in a coarse-to-fine kernel estimation process. In this paper, we propose to learn a deep convolutional neural network for extracting sharp edges from blurred images. Motivated by the success of the existing filtering-based deblurring methods, the proposed model consists of two stages: suppressing extraneous details and enhancing sharp edges. We show that the two-stage model simplifies the learning process and effectively restores sharp edges. Facilitated by the learned sharp edges, the proposed deblurring algorithm does not require any coarse-to-fine strategy or edge selection, thereby significantly simplifying kernel estimation and reducing computation load. Extensive experimental results on challenging blurry images demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world images in terms of visual quality and run-time.",
   "Deep learning guided stroke management: a review of clinical applications.\nStroke is a leading cause of long-term disability, and outcome is directly related to timely intervention. Not all patients benefit from rapid intervention, however. Thus a significant amount of attention has been paid to using neuroimaging to assess potential benefit by identifying areas of ischemia that have not yet experienced cellular death. The perfusion-diffusion mismatch, is used as a simple metric for potential benefit with timely intervention, yet penumbral patterns provide an inaccurate predictor of clinical outcome. Machine learning research in the form of deep learning (artificial intelligence) techniques using deep neural networks (DNNs) excel at working with complex inputs. The key areas where deep learning may be imminently applied to stroke management are image segmentation, automated featurization (radiomics), and multimodal prognostication. The application of convolutional neural networks, the family of DNN architectures designed to work with images, to stroke imaging data is a perfect match between a mature deep learning technique and a data type that is naturally suited to benefit from deep learning's strengths. These powerful tools have opened up exciting opportunities for data-driven stroke management for acute intervention and for guiding prognosis. Deep learning techniques are useful for the speed and power of results they can deliver and will become an increasingly standard tool in the modern stroke specialist's arsenal for delivering personalized medicine to patients with ischemic stroke.",
   "Deep 6-DOF Tracking.\nWe present a temporal 6-DOF tracking method which leverages deep learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance on challenging datasets of real world capture. Our method is both more accurate and more robust to occlusions than the existing best performing approaches while maintaining real-time performance. To assess its efficacy, we evaluate our approach on several challenging RGBD sequences of real objects in a variety of conditions. Notably, we systematically evaluate robustness to occlusions through a series of sequences where the object to be tracked is increasingly occluded. Finally, our approach is purely data-driven and does not require any hand-designed features: robust tracking is automatically learned from data.",
   "Dixon-VIBE Deep Learning (DIVIDE) Pseudo-CT Synthesis for Pelvis PET/MR Attenuation Correction.\nWhole-body attenuation correction (AC) is still challenging in combined PET/MR scanners. We describe Dixon-VIBE Deep Learning (DIVIDE), a deep-learning network that allows synthesizing pelvis pseudo-CT maps based only on the standard Dixon volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination (Dixon-VIBE) images currently acquired for AC in some commercial scanners. Methods: We propose a network that maps between the four 2-dimensional (2D) Dixon MR images (water, fat, in-phase, and out-of-phase) and their corresponding 2D CT image. In contrast to previous methods, we used transposed convolutions to learn the up-sampling parameters, we used whole 2D slices to provide context information, and we pretrained the network with brain images. Twenty-eight datasets obtained from 19 patients who underwent PET/CT and PET/MR examinations were used to evaluate the proposed method. We assessed the accuracy of the \u03bc-maps and reconstructed PET images by performing voxel- and region-based analysis comparing the SUVs (in g/mL) obtained after AC using the Dixon-VIBE (PETDixon), DIVIDE (PETDIVIDE), and CT-based (PETCT) methods. Additionally, the bias in quantification was estimated in synthetic lesions defined in the prostate, rectum, pelvis, and spine. Results: Absolute mean relative change values relative to CT AC were lower than 2% on average for the DIVIDE method in every region of interest except for bone tissue, where it was lower than 4% and 6.75 times smaller than the relative change of the Dixon method. There was an excellent voxel-by-voxel correlation between PETCT and PETDIVIDE (R 2 = 0.9998, P < 0.01). The Bland-Altman plot between PETCT and PETDIVIDE showed that the average of the differences and the variability were lower (mean PETCT-PETDIVIDE SUV, 0.0003; PETCT-PETDIVIDE SD, 0.0094; 95% confidence interval, [-0.0180,0.0188]) than the average of differences between PETCT and PETDixon (mean PETCT-PETDixon SUV, 0.0006; PETCT-PETDixon SD, 0.0264; 95% confidence interval, [-0.0510,0.0524]). Statistically significant changes in PET data quantification were observed between the 2 methods in the synthetic lesions, with the largest improvement in femur and spine lesions. Conclusion: The DIVIDE method can accurately synthesize a pelvis pseudo-CT scan from standard Dixon-VIBE images, allowing for accurate AC in combined PET/MR scanners. Additionally, our implementation allows rapid pseudo-CT synthesis, making it suitable for routine applications and even allowing retrospective processing of Dixon-VIBE data.",
   "The Impact of Three-Dimensional Printed Anatomical Models on First-Year Student Engagement in a Block Mode Delivery.\nStudent engagement is known to have several positive effects on learning outcomes and can impact a student's university experience. High levels of engagement in content-heavy subjects can be difficult to attain. Due to a major institutional restructure, the anatomy prosection laboratory time per subject was dramatically reduced. In response, the authors set out to redesign their anatomy units with a focus on engaging the learning activities that would increase time-on-task both within and outside of the classroom. One of these curriculum changes was the implementation of a suite of anatomy learning activities centered on sets of three-dimensional printed upper limb skeleton models. A two-part mixed-method sequential exploratory design was used to evaluate these activities. Part one was a questionnaire that evaluated the students' engagement with and perceptions of the models. Part two involved focus groups interviews, which were an extension of the survey questions in part one. The results of the study indicated that the majority of students found the models to be an engaging resource that helped improve their study habits. As a result, students strongly felt that the use of the models inspired greater academic confidence and overall better performance in their assessments. Overall, the models were an effective way of increasing the engagement and deep learning, and reinforced previous findings from the medical education research. Future research should investigate the effects of these models on student's grades within osteopathy and other allied health courses.",
   "Conflicts of interest and industry professional relationships in psychiatric neurosurgery: a comparative literature review.\nOBJECTIVE The research required to establish that psychiatric treatments are effective often depends on collaboration between academic clinical researchers and industry. Some of the goals of clinical practice and those of commercial developers of psychiatric therapies overlap, such as developing safe and effective treatments. However, there might also be incompatible goals; physicians aim to provide the best care they can to their patients, whereas the medical industry ultimately aims to develop therapies that are commercially successful. In some cases, however, clinical research may be aiming both at improved patient care and commercial success. It is in these cases that a conflict of interest (COI) arises. The goal of this study was to identify differences and commonalities regarding COIs between 2 kinds of somatic psychiatric interventions: pharmacological and neurosurgical. METHODS The authors conducted a study focused on professional concerns regarding pharmacological and neurosurgical psychiatric interventions. They used medical and bioethics journal articles as an indicator of professionals' concerns and carried out a thematic content analysis of peer-reviewed articles published between 1960 and 2015, using PubMed and Google Scholar. RESULTS One hundred thirty-seven relevant articles were identified, of which 86 papers focused primarily on psychopharmacology and 51 on neurosurgery. The intervention most discussed in the psychiatric neurosurgery data set was deep brain stimulation (n = 42). While there were no significant differences at the level of categories, pharmacological and neurosurgical interventions differ in the underlying themes discussed. Two issues widely discussed in the articles on pharmaceutical interventions, but largely neglected in the neurosurgery articles, were medical professional issues and industry involvement. CONCLUSIONS COIs are a neglected issue in the discussion of ethics concerns regarding medical devices in psychiatry. Yet as these interventions become more common, it is important to address them in part through learning from the discussion regarding COIs in the pharmaceutical industry and by developing approaches to address those aspects of COIs that are unique to the medical device industry.",
   "Use of a Tracer-Specific Deep Artificial Neural Net to Denoise Dynamic PET Images.\nApplication of kinetic modeling (KM) on a voxel level in dynamic PET images frequently suffers from high levels of noise, drastically reducing the precision of parametric image analysis. In this paper, we investigate the use of machine learning and artificial neural networks to denoise dynamic PET images. We train a deep denoising autoencoder (DAE) using noisy and noise-free spatiotemporal image patches, extracted from the simulated images of [11C]raclopride, a dopamine D2 receptor agonist. The DAE-processed dynamic and corresponding parametric images (simulated and acquired) are compared with those obtained with conventional denoising techniques, including temporal and spatial Gaussian smoothing, iterative spatiotemporal smoothing/deconvolution, and the highly constrained backprojection processing (HYPR). The simulated (acquired) parametric image non-uniformity was 7.75% (19.49%) with temporal and 5.90% (14.50%) with spatial smoothing, 5.82% (16.21%) with smoothing/deconvolution, 5.49% (13.38%) with HYPR, and 3.52% (11.41%) with DAE. The DAE also produced the best results in terms of the coefficient of variation of voxel values and structural similarity index. Denoising-induced bias in the regional mean binding potential was 7.8% with temporal and 26.31% with spatial smoothing, 28.61% with smoothing/deconvolution, 27.63% with HYPR, and 14.8% with DAE. When the test data did not match the training data, erroneous outcomes were obtained. Our results demonstrate that a deep DAE can provide a substantial reduction in the voxel-level noise compared with the conventional spatiotemporal denoising methods while introducing a similar or lower amount of bias. The better DAE performance comes at the cost of lower generality and requiring appropriate training data.",

   "A Fault Diagnostic Scheme Based on Capsule Network for Rolling Bearing under Different Rotational Speeds.\nDeep learning-based intelligent fault diagnosis methods have attracted increasing attention for their automatic feature extraction ability. However, existing works are usually under the assumption that the training and test dataset share similar distributions, which unfortunately always violates real practice due to the variety of working conditions. In this paper, an end-to-end scheme of joint use of two-direction signals and capsule network (CN) is proposed for fault diagnosis of rolling bearing. With the help of the superior ability of CN in capturing the spatial position information between features, more valuable information can be mined. Aiming to eliminate the influence of different rotational speeds, vertical and horizontal vibration signals are fused as the input to CN, so that invariant features can be extracted automatically from the raw signals. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experimental data of rolling bearing under different rotational speeds and compared with a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is able to recognize the fault types of rolling bearing under scenarios of different rotational speeds.",
   "Nitric oxide synthase expression in the central nervous system of Sepia officinalis: an in situ hybridization study.\nWe recently reported the molecular cloning of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) mRNA from Sepia officinalis (SoNOS) using a strategy that involves hybridization of degenerate PCR primers to highly conserved NOS regions, combined with a RACE procedure. Here, in situ hybridization study has been performed on serial sections of the cuttlefish central nervous system to reveal localized specific staining of cell bodies in several lobes of the brain. Staining was found in many lower motor centres, including cells of the inferior and superior buccal lobes (feeding centres); in some higher motor centres (anterior basal and peduncle lobes); in learning centres (vertical, subvertical and superior frontal lobes); and in the visual system [medulla and deep retina (optic lobe)]. Positive staining was also found in the olfactory lobe. NOS-expressing cells have been detected also in the interbasal lobe. Double labelling experiments, performed on consecutive sections, showed that neurons containing NOS immunoreactivity were also positive in in situ hybridization staining. All these data support the presence of NOS in several systems in the cuttlefish brain.",
   "Deep-Learning Technique To Convert a Crude Piezoresistive Carbon Nanotube-Ecoflex Composite Sheet into a Smart, Portable, Disposable, and Extremely Flexible Keypad.\nAn extremely simple bulk sheet made of a piezoresistive carbon nanotube (CNT)-Ecoflex composite can act as a smart keypad that is portable, disposable, and flexible enough to be carried crushed inside the pocket of a pair of trousers. Both a rigid-button-imbedded, rollable (or foldable) pad and a patterned flexible pad have been introduced for use as portable keyboards. Herein, we suggest a bare, bulk, macroscale piezoresistive sheet as a replacement for these complex devices that are achievable only through high-cost fabrication processes such as patterning-based coating, printing, deposition, and mounting. A deep-learning technique based on deep neural networks (DNN) enables this extremely simple bulk sheet to play the role of a smart keypad without the use of complicated fabrication processes. To develop this keypad, instantaneous electrical resistance change was recorded at several locations on the edge of the sheet along with the exact information on the touch position and pressure for a huge number of random touches. The recorded data were used for training a DNN model that could eventually act as a brain for a simple sheet-type keypad. This simple sheet-type keypad worked perfectly and outperformed all of the existing portable keypads in terms of functionality, flexibility, disposability, and cost.",
   "Multicolor localization microscopy and point-spread-function engineering by deep learning.\nDeep learning has become an extremely effective tool for image classification and image restoration problems. Here, we apply deep learning to microscopy and demonstrate how neural networks can exploit the chromatic dependence of the point-spread function to classify the colors of single emitters imaged on a grayscale camera. While existing localization microscopy methods for spectral classification require additional optical elements in the emission path, e.g., spectral filters, prisms, or phase masks, our neural net correctly identifies static and mobile emitters with high efficiency using a standard, unmodified single-channel configuration. Furthermore, we show how deep learning can be used to design new phase-modulating elements that, when implemented into the imaging path, result in further improved color differentiation between species, including simultaneously differentiating four species in a single image.",
   "Doing the Impossible: Why Neural Networks Can Be Trained at All.\nAs deep neural networks grow in size, from thousands to millions to billions of weights, the performance of those networks becomes limited by our ability to accurately train them. A common naive question arises: if we have a system with billions of degrees of freedom, don't we also need billions of samples to train it? Of course, the success of deep learning indicates that reliable models can be learned with reasonable amounts of data. Similar questions arise in protein folding, spin glasses and biological neural networks. With effectively infinite potential folding/spin/wiring configurations, how does the system find the precise arrangement that leads to useful and robust results? Simple sampling of the possible configurations until an optimal one is reached is not a viable option even if one waited for the age of the universe. On the contrary, there appears to be a mechanism in the above phenomena that forces them to achieve configurations that live on a low-dimensional manifold, avoiding the curse of dimensionality. In the current work we use the concept of mutual information between successive layers of a deep neural network to elucidate this mechanism and suggest possible ways of exploiting it to accelerate training. We show that adding structure to the neural network leads to higher mutual information between layers. High mutual information between layers implies that the effective number of free parameters is exponentially smaller than the raw number of tunable weights, providing insight into why neural networks with far more weights than training points can be reliably trained.",

The purpose of this article is to explore what AI means for the doctor-patient relationship and for breast imaging radiologists.",
   "SEGMENTATION OF ORGANS AT RISK IN THORACIC CT IMAGES USING A SHARPMASK ARCHITECTURE AND CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELDS.\nCancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Radiotherapy is a standard treatment for this condition and the first step of the radiotherapy process is to identify the target volumes to be targeted and the healthy organs at risk (OAR) to be protected. Unlike previous methods for automatic segmentation of OAR that typically use local information and individually segment each OAR, in this paper, we propose a deep learning framework for the joint segmentation of OAR in CT images of the thorax, specifically the heart, esophagus, trachea and the aorta. Making use of Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN), we present several extensions that improve the performance, including a new architecture that allows to use low level features with high level information, effectively combining local and global information for improving the localization accuracy. Finally, by using Conditional Random Fields (specifically the CRF as Recurrent Neural Network model), we are able to account for relationships between the organs to further improve the segmentation results. Experiments demonstrate competitive performance on a dataset of 30 CT scans.",

   "Sleep spindle detection using deep learning: A validation study based on crowdsourcing.\nSleep spindles are significant transient oscillations observed on the electroencephalogram (EEG) in stage 2 of non-rapid eye movement sleep. Deep belief network (DBN) gaining great successes in images and speech is still a novel method to develop sleep spindle detection system. In this paper, crowdsourcing replacing gold standard was applied to generate three different labeled samples and constructed three classes of datasets with a combination of these samples. An F1-score measure was estimated to compare the performance of DBN to other three classifiers on classifying these samples, with the DBN obtaining an result of 92.78%. Then a comparison of two feature extraction methods based on power spectrum density was made on same dataset using DBN. In addition, the DBN trained in dataset was applied to detect sleep spindle from raw EEG recordings and performed a comparable capacity to expert group consensus.",

VLE has the potential to improve detection of early neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus (BE). However, interpretation of VLE images is complex because of the large amount of data that need to be interpreted in real time. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of a computer algorithm to identify early BE neoplasia on ex\u00a0vivo VLE images.",
   "L1 -Norm Batch Normalization for Efficient Training of Deep Neural Networks.\nBatch normalization (BN) has recently become a standard component for accelerating and improving the training of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, BN brings in additional calculations, consumes more memory, and significantly slows down the training iteration. Furthermore, the nonlinear square and sqrt operations in the normalization process impede low bit-width quantization techniques, which draw much attention to the deep learning hardware community. In this paper, we propose an L1 -norm BN (L1BN) with only linear operations in both forward and backward propagations during training. L1BN is approximately equivalent to the conventional L2 -norm BN (L2BN) by multiplying a scaling factor that equals (\u03c0/2)1/2 . Experiments on various convolutional neural networks and generative adversarial networks reveal that L1BN can maintain the same performance and convergence rate as L2BN but with higher computational efficiency. In real application-specified integrated circuit synthesis with reduced resources, L1BN achieves 25% speedup and 37% energy saving compared to the original L2BN. Our hardware-friendly normalization method not only surpasses L2BN in speed but also simplifies the design of deep learning accelerators. Last but not least, L1BN promises a fully quantized training of DNNs, which empowers future artificial intelligence applications on mobile devices with transfer and continual learning capability.",
   "Vulnerability of classifiers to evolutionary generated adversarial examples.\nThis paper deals with the vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial examples and its implication for robustness and generalization properties. We propose an evolutionary algorithm that can generate adversarial examples for any machine learning model in the black-box attack scenario. This way, we can find adversarial examples without access to model's parameters, only by querying the model at hand. We have tested a range of machine learning models including deep and shallow neural networks. Our experiments have shown that the vulnerability to adversarial examples is not only the problem of deep networks, but it spreads through various machine learning architectures. Rather, it depends on the type of computational units. Local units, such as Gaussian kernels, are less vulnerable to adversarial examples.",
   "CardioXNet: Automated Detection for Cardiomegaly Based on Deep Learning.\nIn this paper, we present an automated procedure to determine the presence of cardiomegaly on chest X-ray image based on deep learning. The proposed algorithm CardioXNet uses deep learning methods U-NET and cardiothoracic ratio for diagnosis of cardiomegaly from chest X-rays. U-NET learns the segmentation task from the ground truth data. OpenCV is used to denoise and maintain the precision of region of interest once minor errors occur. Therefore, Cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) is calculated as a criterion to determine cardiomegaly from U-net segmentations. End-to-end Dense-Net neural network is used as baseline. This study has shown that the feasibility of combing deep learning segmentation and medical criterion to automatically recognize heart disease in medical images with high accuracy and agreement with the clinical results.",

Application of machine learning algorithms was useful to build prediction models to gain insights about dental health and minority population aging.",
   "Combining deep learning with token selection for patient phenotyping from electronic health records.\nArtificial intelligence provides the opportunity to reveal important information buried in large amounts of complex data. Electronic health records (eHRs) are a source of such big data that provide a multitude of health related clinical information about patients. However, text data from eHRs, e.g., discharge summary notes, are challenging in their analysis because these notes are free-form texts and the writing formats and styles vary considerably between different records. For this reason, in this paper we study deep learning neural networks in combination with natural language processing to analyze text data from clinical discharge summaries. We provide a detail analysis of patient phenotyping, i.e., the automatic prediction of ten patient disorders, by investigating the influence of network architectures, sample sizes and information content of tokens. Importantly, for patients suffering from Chronic Pain, the disorder that is the most difficult one to classify, we find the largest performance gain for a combined word- and sentence-level input convolutional neural network (ws-CNN). As a general result, we find that the combination of data quality and data quantity of the text data is playing a crucial role for using more complex network architectures that improve significantly beyond a word-level input CNN model. From our investigations of learning curves and token selection mechanisms, we conclude that for such a transition one requires larger sample sizes because the amount of information per sample is quite small and only carried by few tokens and token categories. Interestingly, we found that the token frequency in the eHRs follow a Zipf law and we utilized this behavior to investigate the information content of tokens by defining a token selection mechanism. The latter addresses also issues of explainable AI.",
   "Predicting ischemic stroke tissue fate using a deep convolutional neural network on source magnetic resonance perfusion images.\nPredicting infarct volume from magnetic resonance perfusion-weighted imaging can provide helpful information to clinicians in deciding how aggressively to treat acute stroke patients. Models have been developed to predict tissue fate, yet these models are mostly built using hand-crafted features (e.g., time-to-maximum) derived from perfusion images, which are sensitive to deconvolution methods. We demonstrate the application of deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) on predicting final stroke infarct volume using only the source perfusion images. We propose a deep CNN architecture that improves feature learning and achieves an area under the curve of 0.871 \u00b1 0.024 , outperforming existing tissue fate models. We further validate the proposed deep CNN with existing 2-D and 3-D deep CNNs for images/video classification, showing the importance of the proposed architecture. Our work leverages deep learning techniques in stroke tissue outcome prediction, advancing magnetic resonance imaging perfusion analysis one step closer to an operational decision support tool for stroke treatment guidance.",
   "Application of artificial intelligence in ophthalmology.\nArtificial intelligence is a general term that means to accomplish a task mainly by a computer, with the least human beings participation, and it is widely accepted as the invention of robots. With the development of this new technology, artificial intelligence has been one of the most influential information technology revolutions. We searched these English-language studies relative to ophthalmology published on PubMed and Springer databases. The application of artificial intelligence in ophthalmology mainly concentrates on the diseases with a high incidence, such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, retinopathy of prematurity, age-related or congenital cataract and few with retinal vein occlusion. According to the above studies, we conclude that the sensitivity of detection and accuracy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy ranged from 75% to 91.7%, for non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy ranged from 75% to 94.7%, for age-related macular degeneration it ranged from 75% to 100%, for retinopathy of prematurity ranged over 95%, for retinal vein occlusion just one study reported ranged over 97%, for glaucoma ranged 63.7% to 93.1%, and for cataract it achieved a more than 70% similarity against clinical grading.",

   "LitGen: Genetic Literature Recommendation Guided by Human Explanations.\nAs genetic sequencing costs decrease, the lack of clinical interpretation of variants has become the bottleneck in using genetics data. A major rate limiting step in clinical interpretation is the manual curation of evidence in the genetic literature by highly trained biocurators. What makes curation particularly time-consuming is that the curator needs to identify papers that study variant pathogenicity using different types of approaches and evidences-e.g. biochemical assays or case control analysis. In collaboration with the Clinical Genomic Resource (ClinGen)-the flagship NIH program for clinical curation-we propose the first machine learning system, LitGen, that can retrieve papers for a particular variant and filter them by specific evidence types used by curators to assess for pathogenicity. LitGen uses semi-supervised deep learning to predict the type of evi+dence provided by each paper. It is trained on papers annotated by ClinGen curators and systematically evaluated on new test data collected by ClinGen. LitGen further leverages rich human explanations and unlabeled data to gain 7.9%-12.6% relative performance improvement over models learned only on the annotated papers. It is a useful framework to improve clinical variant curation.",
   "A Deep Convolutional Coupling Network for Change Detection Based on Heterogeneous Optical and Radar Images.\nWe propose an unsupervised deep convolutional coupling network for change detection based on two heterogeneous images acquired by optical sensors and radars on different dates. Most existing change detection methods are based on homogeneous images. Due to the complementary properties of optical and radar sensors, there is an increasing interest in change detection based on heterogeneous images. The proposed network is symmetric with each side consisting of one convolutional layer and several coupling layers. The two input images connected with the two sides of the network, respectively, are transformed into a feature space where their feature representations become more consistent. In this feature space, the different map is calculated, which then leads to the ultimate detection map by applying a thresholding algorithm. The network parameters are learned by optimizing a coupling function. The learning process is unsupervised, which is different from most existing change detection methods based on heterogeneous images. Experimental results on both homogenous and heterogeneous images demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed network compared with several existing approaches.",
   "Anatomical context improves deep learning on the brain age estimation task.\nDeep learning has shown remarkable improvements in the analysis of medical images without the need for engineered features. In this work, we hypothesize that deep learning is complementary to traditional feature estimation. We propose a network design to include traditional structural imaging features alongside deep convolutional ones and illustrate this approach on the task of imaging-based age prediction in two separate contexts: T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (N\u202f=\u202f5121, ages 4-96, healthy controls) and computed tomography (CT) of the head (N\u202f=\u202f1313, ages 1-97, healthy controls). In brain MRI, we can predict age with a mean absolute error of 4.08\u202fyears by combining raw images along with engineered structural features, compared to 5.00\u202fyears using image-derived features alone and 8.23\u202fyears using structural features alone. In head CT, we can predict age with a median absolute error of 9.99\u202fyears combining features, compared to 11.02\u202fyears with image-derived features alone and 13.28\u202fyears with structural features alone. These results show that we can complement traditional feature estimation using deep learning to improve prediction tasks. As the field of medical image processing continues to integrate deep learning, it will be important to use the new techniques to complement traditional imaging features instead of fully displacing them.",
   "Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Modeling for Drug Discovery.\nDue to the massive data sets available for drug candidates, modern drug discovery has advanced to the big data era. Central to this shift is the development of artificial intelligence approaches to implementing innovative modeling based on the dynamic, heterogeneous, and large nature of drug data sets. As a result, recently developed artificial intelligence approaches such as deep learning and relevant modeling studies provide new solutions to efficacy and safety evaluations of drug candidates based on big data modeling and analysis. The resulting models provided deep insights into the continuum from chemical structure to in vitro, in vivo, and clinical outcomes. The relevant novel data mining, curation, and management techniques provided critical support to recent modeling studies. In summary, the new advancement of artificial intelligence in the big data era has paved the road to future rational drug development and optimization, which will have a significant impact on drug discovery procedures and, eventually, public health.",
   "Recent applications of deep learning and machine intelligence on in silico drug discovery: methods, tools and databases.\nThe identification of interactions between drugs/compounds and their targets is crucial for the development of new drugs. In vitro screening experiments (i.e. bioassays) are frequently used for this purpose; however, experimental approaches are insufficient to explore novel drug-target interactions, mainly because of feasibility problems, as they are labour intensive, costly and time consuming. A computational field known as 'virtual screening' (VS) has emerged in the past decades to aid experimental drug discovery studies by statistically estimating unknown bio-interactions between compounds and biological targets. These methods use the physico-chemical and structural properties of compounds and/or target proteins along with the experimentally verified bio-interaction information to generate predictive models. Lately, sophisticated machine learning techniques are applied in VS to elevate the predictive performance. The objective of this study is to examine and discuss the recent applications of machine learning techniques in VS, including deep learning, which became highly popular after giving rise to epochal developments in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. The past 3 years have witnessed an unprecedented amount of research studies considering the application of deep learning in biomedicine, including computational drug discovery. In this review, we first describe the main instruments of VS methods, including compound and protein features (i.e. representations and descriptors), frequently used libraries and toolkits for VS, bioactivity databases and gold-standard data sets for system training and benchmarking. We subsequently review recent VS studies with a strong emphasis on deep learning applications. Finally, we discuss the present state of the field, including the current challenges and suggest future directions. We believe that this survey will provide insight to the researchers working in the field of computational drug discovery in terms of comprehending and developing novel bio-prediction methods.",
   "Cell mitosis event analysis in phase contrast microscopy images using deep learning.\nIn this paper, we solve the problem of mitosis event localization and its stage localization in time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy images. Our method contains three steps: first, we formulate a Low-Rank Matrix Recovery (LRMR) model to find salient regions from microscopy images and extract candidate patch sequences, which potentially contain mitosis events; second, we classify each candidate patch sequence by our proposed Hierarchical Convolution Neural Network (HCNN) with visual appearance and motion cues; third, for the detected mitosis sequences, we further segment them into four temporal stages by our proposed Two-stream Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (TS-BLSTM). In the experiments, we validate our system (LRMR, HCNN, and TS-BLSTM) and evaluate the mitosis event localization and stage localization performance. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-arts by achieving 99.2% precision and 98.0% recall for mitosis event localization and 0.62 frame error on average for mitosis stage localization in five challenging image sequences.",
   "An Improved Method for Prediction of Cancer Prognosis by Network Learning.\nAccurate identification of prognostic biomarkers is an important yet challenging goal in bioinformatics. Many bioinformatics approaches have been proposed for this purpose, but there is still room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning-based method for more accurate identification of prognostic biomarker genes and use them for prediction of cancer prognosis. The proposed method specifies the candidate prognostic gene module by graph learning using the generative adversarial networks (GANs) model, and scores genes using a PageRank algorithm. We applied the proposed method to multiple-omics data that included copy number, gene expression, DNA methylation, and somatic mutation data for five cancer types. The proposed method showed better prediction accuracy than did existing methods. We identified many prognostic genes and their roles in their biological pathways. We also showed that the genes identified from different omics data were complementary, which led to improved accuracy in prediction using multi-omics data.",
   "Joint Region and Nucleus Segmentation for Characterization of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes in Breast Cancer.\nHistologic assessment of stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (sTIL) as a surrogate of the host immune response has been shown to be prognostic and potentially chemo-predictive in triple-negative and HER2-positive breast cancers. The current practice of manual assessment is prone to intra- and inter-observer variability. Furthermore, the inter-play of sTILs, tumor cells, other microenvironment mediators, their spatial relationships, quantity, and other image-based features have yet to be determined exhaustively and systemically. Towards analysis of these aspects, we developed a deep learning based method for joint region-level and nucleus-level segmentation and classification of breast cancer H&E tissue whole slide images. Our proposed method simultaneously identifies tumor, fibroblast, and lymphocyte nuclei, along with key histologic region compartments including tumor and stroma. We also show how the resultant segmentation masks can be combined with seeding approaches to yield accurate nucleus classifications. Furthermore, we outline a simple workflow for calibrating computational scores to human scores for consistency. The pipeline identifies key compartments with high accuracy (Dice= overall: 0.78, tumor: 0.83, and fibroblasts: 0.77). ROC AUC for nucleus classification is high at 0.89 (micro-average), 0.89 (lymphocytes), 0.90 (tumor), and 0.78 (fibroblasts). Spearman correlation between computational sTIL and pathologist consensus is high (R=0.73, p<0.001) and is higher than inter-pathologist correlation (R=0.66, p<0.001). Both manual and computational sTIL scores successfully stratify patients by clinical progression outcomes.",
   "In Silico Target Prediction for Small Molecules.\nDrugs modulate disease states through their actions on targets in the body. Determining these targets aids the focused development of new treatments, and helps to better characterize those already employed. One means of accomplishing this is through the deployment of in silico methodologies, harnessing computational analytical and predictive power to produce educated hypotheses for experimental verification. Here, we provide an overview of the current state of the art, describe some of the well-established methods in detail, and reflect on how they, and emerging technologies promoting the incorporation of complex and heterogeneous data-sets, can be employed to improve our understanding of (poly)pharmacology.",
   "Unexpected Complication of a Multinodular Goitre.\nMultinodular goitre is the most common thyroid gland disorder. It can cause hyperthyroidism and mechanical complaints such as tracheal compression or dysphagia. We report a unique case of a patient with a toxic multinodular goitre presenting with a deep venous thrombosis of the left arm due to direct local compression of blood flow.",
   "Artificial neural network filters for enhancing 3D optical microscopy images of neurites.\nThe ability to extract accurate morphology of labeled neurons from microscopy images is crucial for mapping brain connectivity and for understanding changes in connectivity that underlie learning and neurological disorders. There are, however, two problems, specific to optical microscopy imaging of neurons, which make accurate neuron tracing exceedingly challenging: (i) neurites can appear broken due to inhomogeneous labeling and (ii) neurites can appear fused in 3D due to limited resolution. Here, we propose and evaluate several artificial neural network (ANN) architectures and conventional image enhancement filters with the aim of alleviating both problems. We developed four image quality metrics to evaluate the effects of the proposed filters: normalized intensity in the cross-over regions between neurites, effective radius of neurites, coefficient of variation of intensity along neurites, and local background to neurite intensity ratio. Our results show that ANN-based filters, trained on optimized semi-manual traces of neurites, can significantly outperform conventional filters. In particular, U-Net based filtering can virtually eliminate background intensity, while also reducing the effective radius of neurites to nearly 1 voxel. In addition, this filter significantly decreases intensity in the cross-over regions between neurites and reduces fluctuations of intensity on neurites' centerlines. These results suggest that including an ANN-based filtering step, which does not require substantial extra time or computing power, can be beneficial for automated neuron tracing projects.",
   "Unsupervised Pre-training of a Deep LSTM-based Stacked Autoencoder for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Problems.\nCurrently, most real-world time series datasets are multivariate and are rich in dynamical information of the underlying system. Such datasets are attracting much attention; therefore, the need for accurate modelling of such high-dimensional datasets is increasing. Recently, the deep architecture of the recurrent neural network (RNN) and its variant long short-term memory (LSTM) have been proven to be more accurate than traditional statistical methods in modelling time series data. Despite the reported advantages of the deep LSTM model, its performance in modelling multivariate time series (MTS) data has not been satisfactory, particularly when attempting to process highly non-linear and long-interval MTS datasets. The reason is that the supervised learning approach initializes the neurons randomly in such recurrent networks, disabling the neurons that ultimately must properly learn the latent features of the correlated variables included in the MTS dataset. In this paper, we propose a pre-trained LSTM-based stacked autoencoder (LSTM-SAE) approach in an unsupervised learning fashion to replace the random weight initialization strategy adopted in deep LSTM recurrent networks. For evaluation purposes, two different case studies that include real-world datasets are investigated, where the performance of the proposed approach compares favourably with the deep LSTM approach. In addition, the proposed approach outperforms several reference models investigating the same case studies. Overall, the experimental results clearly show that the unsupervised pre-training approach improves the performance of deep LSTM and leads to better and faster convergence than other models.",
   "Radiomics Response Signature for Identification of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Sensitive to Therapies Targeting EGFR Pathway.\nTo forecast survival and enhance treatment decisions for patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases (mCRC) by using on-treatment radiomics signature to predict tumor sensitiveness to FOLFIRI\u00b1cetuximab.",
   "Deep Learning in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.\nGastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is used to inspect the lumen or interior of the GI tract for several purposes, including, (1) making a clinical diagnosis, in real time, based on the visual appearances; (2) taking targeted tissue samples for subsequent histopathological examination; and (3) in some cases, performing therapeutic interventions targeted at specific lesions. GI endoscopy is therefore predicated on the assumption that the operator-the endoscopist-is able to identify and characterize abnormalities or lesions accurately and reproducibly. However, as in other areas of clinical medicine, such as histopathology and radiology, many studies have documented marked interobserver and intraobserver variability in lesion recognition. Thus, there is a clear need and opportunity for techniques or methodologies that will enhance the quality of lesion recognition and diagnosis and improve the outcomes of GI endoscopy. Deep learning models provide a basis to make better clinical decisions in medical image analysis. Biomedical image segmentation, classification, and registration can be improved with deep learning. Recent evidence suggests that the application of deep learning methods to medical image analysis can contribute significantly to computer-aided diagnosis. Deep learning models are usually considered to be more flexible and provide reliable solutions for image analysis problems compared to conventional computer vision models. The use of fast computers offers the possibility of real-time support that is important for endoscopic diagnosis, which has to be made in real time. Advanced graphics processing units and cloud computing have also favored the use of machine learning, and more particularly, deep learning for patient care. This paper reviews the rapidly evolving literature on the feasibility of applying deep learning algorithms to endoscopic imaging.",
   "Transfer Learning From Convolutional Neural Networks for Computer-Aided Diagnosis: A Comparison of Digital Breast Tomosynthesis and Full-Field Digital Mammography.\nWith the growing adoption of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in breast cancer screening, we compare the performance of deep learning computer-aided diagnosis on DBT images to that of conventional full-field digital mammography (FFDM).",
   "Cortical graph neural network for AD and MCI diagnosis and transfer learning across populations.\nCombining machine learning with neuroimaging data has a great potential for early diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it remains unclear how well the classifiers built on one population can predict MCI/AD diagnosis of other populations. This study aimed to employ a spectral graph convolutional neural network (graph-CNN), that incorporated cortical thickness and geometry, to identify MCI and AD based on 3089 T1-weighted MRI data of the ADNI-2 cohort, and to evaluate its feasibility to predict AD in the ADNI-1 cohort (n\u202f=\u202f3602) and an Asian cohort (n\u202f=\u202f347). For the ADNI-2 cohort, the graph-CNN showed classification accuracy of controls (CN) vs. AD at 85.8% and early MCI (EMCI) vs. AD at 79.2%, followed by CN vs. late MCI (LMCI) (69.3%), LMCI vs. AD (65.2%), EMCI vs. LMCI (60.9%), and CN vs. EMCI (51.8%). We demonstrated the robustness of the graph-CNN among the existing deep learning approaches, such as Euclidean-domain-based multilayer network and 1D CNN on cortical thickness, and 2D and 3D CNNs on T1-weighted MR images of the ADNI-2 cohort. The graph-CNN also achieved the prediction on the conversion of EMCI to AD at 75% and that of LMCI to AD at 92%. The find-tuned graph-CNN further provided a promising CN vs. AD classification accuracy of 89.4% on the ADNI-1 cohort and >90% on the Asian cohort. Our study demonstrated the feasibility to transfer AD/MCI classifiers learned from one population to the other. Notably, incorporating cortical geometry in CNN has the potential to improve classification performance.",
   "The cerebellum's role in reading: a functional MR imaging study.\nLong considered to have a role limited largely to motor-related functions, the cerebellum has recently been implicated as being involved in both perceptual and cognitive processes.

   "Image-based 3D Object Reconstruction: State-of-the-Art and Trends in the Deep Learning Era.\n3D reconstruction is a longstanding ill-posed problem, which has been explored for decades by the computer vision, computer graphics, and machine learning communities. Since 2015, image-based 3D reconstruction using convolutional neural networks (CNN) has attracted increasing interest and demonstrated an impressive performance. Given this new era of rapid evolution, this article provides a comprehensive survey of the recent developments in this field. We focus on the works which use deep learning techniques to estimate the 3D shape of generic objects either from a single or multiple RGB images. We organize the literature based on the shape representations, the network architectures, and the training mechanisms they use. While this survey is intended for methods which reconstruct generic objects, we also review some of the recent works which focus on specific object classes such as human body shapes and faces. We provide an analysis and comparison of the performance of some key papers, summarize some of the open problems in this field, and discuss promising directions for future research.",
   "Teaching neuroanatomy using computer-aided learning: What makes for successful outcomes?\nComputer-aided learning (CAL) is an integral part of many medical courses. The neuroscience course at Oxford University for medical students includes CAL course of neuroanatomy. CAL is particularly suited to this since neuroanatomy requires much detailed three-dimensional visualization, which can be presented on screen. The CAL course was evaluated using the concept of approach to learning. The aims of university teaching are congruent with the deep approach-seeking meaning and relating new information to previous knowledge-rather than to the surface approach of concentrating on rote learning of detail. Seven cohorts of medical students (N\u00a0=\u00a0869) filled in approach to learning scale and a questionnaire investigating their engagement with the CAL course. The students' scores on CAL-course-based neuroanatomy assessment and later university examinations were obtained. Although the students reported less use of the deep approach for the neuroanatomy CAL course than for the rest of their neuroanatomy course (mean\u00a0=\u00a024.99 vs. 31.49, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), deep approach for CAL was positively correlated with neuroanatomy assessment performance (r\u00a0=\u00a00.12, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Time spent on the CAL course, enjoyment of it, the amount of CAL videos watched and quizzes completed were each significantly positively related to deep approach. The relationship between deep approach and enjoyment was particularly notable (25.5% shared variance). Reported relationships between deep approach and academic performance support the desirability of deep approach in university students. It is proposed that enjoyment of the course and the deep approach could be increased by incorporation of more clinical material which is what the students liked most. Anat Sci Educ 10: 560-569.",
   "Dissecting Machine-Learning Prediction of Molecular Activity: Is an Applicability Domain Needed for Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship Models Based on Deep Neural Networks?\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) are the major drivers of recent progress in artificial intelligence. They have emerged as the machine-learning method of choice in solving image and speech recognition problems, and their potential has raised the expectation of similar breakthroughs in other fields of study. In this work, we compared three machine-learning methods-DNN, random forest (a popular conventional method), and variable nearest neighbor (arguably the simplest method)-in their ability to predict the molecular activities of 21 in vivo and in vitro data sets. Surprisingly, the overall performance of the three methods was similar. For molecules with structurally close near neighbors in the training sets, all methods gave reliable predictions, whereas for molecules increasingly dissimilar to the training molecules, all three methods gave progressively poorer predictions. For molecules sharing little to no structural similarity with the training molecules, all three methods gave a nearly constant value-approximately the average activity of all training molecules-as their predictions. The results confirm conclusions deduced from analyzing molecular applicability domains for accurate predictions, i.e., the most important determinant of the accuracy of predicting a molecule is its similarity to the training samples. This highlights the fact that even in the age of deep learning, developing a truly high-quality model relies less on the choice of machine-learning approach and more on the availability of experimental efforts to generate sufficient training data of structurally diverse compounds. The results also indicate that the distance to training molecules offers a natural and intuitive basis for defining applicability domains to flag reliable and unreliable quantitative structure-activity relationship predictions.",

   "De-multiplexing vortex modes in optical communications using transport-based pattern recognition.\nFree space optical communications utilizing orbital angular momentum beams have recently emerged as a new technique for communications with potential for increased channel capacity. Turbulence due to changes in the index of refraction emanating from temperature, humidity, and air flow patterns, however, add nonlinear effects to the received patterns, thus making the demultiplexing task more difficult. Deep learning techniques have been previously been applied to solve the demultiplexing problem as an image classification task. Here we make use of a newly developed theory suggesting a link between image turbulence and photon transport through the continuity equation to describe a method that utilizes a \"shallow\" learning method instead. The decoding technique is tested and compared against previous approaches using deep convolutional neural networks. Results show that the new method can obtain similar classification accuracies (bit error ratio) at a small fraction (1/90) of the computational cost, thus enabling higher bit rates.",
   "Image-guided preoperative prediction of pyramidal tract side effect in deep brain stimulation: proof of concept and application to the pyramidal tract side effect induced by pallidal stimulation.\nDeep brain stimulation of the medial globus pallidus (GPm) is a surgical procedure for treating patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. Its therapeutic effect may be limited by the presence of pyramidal tract side effect (PTSE). PTSE is a contraction time-locked to the stimulation when the current spreading reaches the motor fibers of the pyramidal tract within the internal capsule. The objective of the study was to propose a preoperative predictive model of PTSE. A machine learning-based method called PyMAN (PTSE model based on artificial neural network) accounting for the current used in stimulation, the three-dimensional electrode coordinates and the angle of the trajectory, was designed to predict the occurrence of PTSE. Ten patients implanted in the GPm have been tested by a clinician to create a labeled dataset of the stimulation parameters that trigger PTSE. The kappa index value between the data predicted by PyMAN and the labeled data was 0.78. Further evaluation studies are desirable to confirm whether PyMAN could be a reliable tool for assisting the surgeon to prevent PTSE during the preoperative planning.",
   "Displacement Estimation in Ultrasound Elastography using Pyramidal Convolutional Neural Network.\nIn this paper, two novel deep learning methods are proposed for displacement estimation in ultrasound elastography. Although Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been very successful for displacement estimation in computer vision, they have been rarely used for ultrasound elastography. One of the main limitations is that the Radio Frequency (RF) ultrasound data, which is crucial for precise displacement estimation, has vastly different frequency characteristics compared to images in computer vision. Top-rank CNN methods used in computer vision applications are mostly based on a multi-level strategy which estimates finer resolution based on coarser ones. This strategy does not work well for RF data due to its large high frequency content. To mitigate the problem, we propose Modified Pyramid, Warping and Cost volume Network (MPWC-Net) and RFMPWC-Net, both based on PWC-Net, to exploit information in RF data by employing two different strategies. We obtained promising results using networks trained only on computer vision images. In the next step, we constructed a large ultrasound simulation database, and proposed a new loss function to fine-tune the network to improve its performance. The proposed networks and well-known optical flow networks as well as state-of-the-art elastography methods are evaluated using simulation, phantom and in vivo data. Our two proposed networks substantially outperform current deep learning methods in terms of Contrast to Noise Ratio (CNR) and Strain Ratio (SR). Also, the proposed methods perform similar to the state-of-the-art elastography methods in terms of CNR and have better SR by substantially reducing the underestimation bias.",
   "Application of artificial intelligence using convolutional neural networks in determining the invasion depth of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.\nIn Japan, endoscopic resection (ER) is often used to treat esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) when invasion depths are diagnosed as EP-SM1, whereas ESCC cases deeper than SM2 are treated by surgical operation or chemoradiotherapy. Therefore, it is crucial to determine the invasion depth of ESCC via preoperative endoscopic examination. Recently, rapid progress in the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) with deep learning in medical fields has been achieved. In this study, we demonstrate the diagnostic ability of AI to measure ESCC invasion depth.",
   "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Automatic Detection of Orbital Blowout Fractures.\nOrbital blow out fracture is a common disease in emergency department and a delay or failure in diagnosis can lead to permanent visual changes. This study aims to evaluate the ability of an automatic orbital blowout fractures detection system based on computed tomography (CT) data.Orbital CT scans of adult orbital blowout fractures patients and normal cases were obtained from Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital between January and March 2017. The region of fractures was annotated using 3D Slicer. The Inception V3 convolutional neural networks were constructed utilizing the Python programming language with PyTorch as the framework to extract high dimension features from each slice in a CT scan. These extracted features are processed through a XGBoost model to make the final differentiation of fracture cases and nonfracture ones. Accuracy, receiver operating characteristics, and area under the curve were evaluated.This study used 94 CT scans diagnosed with orbital blowout fractures and 94 healthy control cases. The automatic detection system showed accuracy of 92% in single-image classification and 87% in patient level detection. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.9574.Using a deep learning-based automatic detection system of orbital blowout fracture can accurately detect and classify orbital blowout fractures from CT scans. The convolutional neural networks model combined with an accurate annotation system could achieve good performance in a small dataset. Further studies with large and multicenter data are required to refine this technology for possible clinical applications.",
   "Measurement of Conditional Relatedness Between Genes Using Fully Convolutional Neural Network.\nMeasuring conditional relatedness, the degree of relation between a pair of genes in a certain condition, is a basic but difficult task in bioinformatics, as traditional co-expression analysis methods rely on co-expression similarities, well known with high false positive rate. Complement with prior-knowledge similarities is a feasible way to tackle the problem. However, classical combination machine learning algorithms fail in detection and application of the complex mapping relations between similarities and conditional relatedness, so a powerful predictive model will have enormous benefit for measuring this kind of complex mapping relations. To this need, we propose a novel deep learning model of convolutional neural network with a fully connected first layer, named fully convolutional neural network (FCNN), to measure conditional relatedness between genes using both co-expression and prior-knowledge similarities. The results on validation and test datasets show FCNN model yields an average 3.0% and 2.7% higher accuracy values for identifying gene-gene interactions collected from the COXPRESdb, KEGG, and TRRUST databases, and a benchmark dataset of Xiao-Yong et al. research, by grid-search 10-fold cross validation, respectively. In order to estimate the FCNN model, we conduct a further verification on the GeneFriends and DIP datasets, and the FCNN model obtains an average of 1.8% and 7.6% higher accuracy, respectively. Then the FCNN model is applied to construct cancer gene networks, and also calls more practical results than other compared models and methods. A website of the FCNN model and relevant datasets can be accessed from https://bmbl.bmi.osumc.edu/FCNN.",
   "Rise of Deep Learning for Genomic, Proteomic, and Metabolomic Data Integration in Precision Medicine.\nMachine learning (ML) is being ubiquitously incorporated into everyday products such as Internet search, email spam filters, product recommendations, image classification, and speech recognition. New approaches for highly integrated manufacturing and automation such as the Industry 4.0 and the Internet of things are also converging with ML methodologies. Many approaches incorporate complex artificial neural network architectures and are collectively referred to as deep learning (DL) applications. These methods have been shown capable of representing and learning predictable relationships in many diverse forms of data and hold promise for transforming the future of omics research and applications in precision medicine. Omics and electronic health record data pose considerable challenges for DL. This is due to many factors such as low signal to noise, analytical variance, and complex data integration requirements. However, DL models have already been shown capable of both improving the ease of data encoding and predictive model performance over alternative approaches. It may not be surprising that concepts encountered in DL share similarities with those observed in biological message relay systems such as gene, protein, and metabolite networks. This expert review examines the challenges and opportunities for DL at a systems and biological scale for a precision medicine readership.",
   "DeepCNF-D: Predicting Protein Order/Disorder Regions by Weighted Deep Convolutional Neural Fields.\nIntrinsically disordered proteins or protein regions are involved in key biological processes including regulation of transcription, signal transduction, and alternative splicing. Accurately predicting order/disorder regions ab initio from the protein sequence is a prerequisite step for further analysis of functions and mechanisms for these disordered regions. This work presents a learning method, weighted DeepCNF (Deep Convolutional Neural Fields), to improve the accuracy of order/disorder prediction by exploiting the long-range sequential information and the interdependency between adjacent order/disorder labels and by assigning different weights for each label during training and prediction to solve the label imbalance issue. Evaluated by the CASP9 and CASP10 targets, our method obtains 0.855 and 0.898 AUC values, which are higher than the state-of-the-art single ab initio predictors.",

   "Deep learning outperformed 11 pathologists in the classification of histopathological melanoma images.\nThe diagnosis of most cancers is made by a board-certified pathologist based on a tissue biopsy under the microscope. Recent research reveals a high discordance between individual pathologists. For melanoma, the literature reports on 25-26% of discordance for classifying a benign nevus versus malignant melanoma. A recent study indicated the potential of deep learning to lower these discordances. However, the performance of deep learning in classifying histopathologic melanoma images was never compared directly to human experts. The aim of this study is to perform such a first direct comparison.",
   "SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) infection: is fetal surgery in times of national disasters reasonable?\nEven though the global COVID-19 pandemic may affect how medical care is delivered in general, most countries try to maintain steady access for women to routine pregnancy care, including fetal anomaly screening. This means that, also during this pandemic, fetal anomalies will be detected, and that discussions regarding invasive genetic testing and possibly fetal therapy will need to take place. For patients, concerns about Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus 2 will add to the anxiety caused by the diagnosis of a serious fetal anomaly. Yet, also for fetal medicine teams the situation gets more complex as they must weigh up the risks and benefits to the fetus as well as the mother, while managing a changing evidence base and logistic challenges in their healthcare system.",

   "Anosmia as a prominent symptom of COVID-19 infection.\nAccording to WHO recommendations, everyone must protect themselves against Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which will also protect others. Due to the lack of current effective treatment and vaccine for COVID-19, screening, rapid diagnosis and isolation of the patients are essential (1, 2). Therefore, identifying the early symptoms of COVID-19 is of particular importance and is a health system priority. Early studies from COVID-19 outbreak in China have illustrated several non-specific signs and symptoms in infected patients, including fever, dry cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, lymphopenia, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia (3, 4). Recently, a probability of association between COVID-19 and altered olfactory function has been reported in South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, UK and the United States (5-8). However, to our knowledge, the definite association between COVID-19 and anosmia has not been published.",

   "Epidemiological Identification of A Novel Pathogen in Real Time: Analysis of the Atypical Pneumonia Outbreak in Wuhan, China, 2019-2020.\nVirological tests have now shown conclusively that a novel coronavirus is causing the 2019-2020 atypical pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China. We demonstrate that non-virological descriptive characteristics could have determined that the outbreak is caused by a novel pathogen in advance of virological testing. Characteristics of the ongoing outbreak were collected in real time from two medical social media sites. These were compared against characteristics of eleven pathogens that have previously caused cases of atypical pneumonia. The probability that the current outbreak is due to \"Disease X\" (i.e., previously unknown etiology) as opposed to one of the known pathogens was inferred, and this estimate was updated as the outbreak continued. The probability (expressed as a percentage) that Disease X is driving the outbreak was assessed as over 29% on 31 December 2019, one week before virus identification. After some specific pathogens were ruled out by laboratory tests on 5 January 2020, the inferred probability of Disease X was over 49%. We showed quantitatively that the emerging outbreak of atypical pneumonia cases is consistent with causation by a novel pathogen. The proposed approach, which uses only routinely observed non-virological data, can aid ongoing risk assessments in advance of virological test results becoming available.",

Despite massive attempts to contain the disease in China, the virus has spread globally, and COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. Here we provide a short background on coronaviruses and describe in more detail the novel SARS-CoV-2 and attempts to identify effective therapies against COVID-19.",
   "COVID-19 information propagation dynamics in the Chinese Sina-microblog.\nThe outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) generated an outbreak of public opinions in the Chinese Sina-microblog.

We develop the M-SDI model, based on the public discussion quantity and take into account of the behavior that users may re-enter another related topic or Weibo after discussing one. Data fitting using the real data of COVID-19 public opinion obtained from Chinese Sina-microblog can parameterize the model to make accurate prediction of the public opinion trend until the next major news item occurs.

   "COVID-19 epidemic in Switzerland: on the importance of testing, contact tracing and isolation.\nSwitzerland is among the countries with the highest number of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases per capita in the world. There are likely many people with undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection because testing efforts are currently not detecting all infected people, including some with clinical disease compatible with COVID-19. Testing on its own will not stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Testing is part of a strategy. The World Health Organization recommends a combination of measures: rapid diagnosis and immediate isolation of cases, rigorous tracking and precautionary self-isolation of close contacts. In this article, we explain why the testing strategy in Switzerland should be strengthened urgently, as a core component of a combination approach to control COVID-19.",
   "Consideration of the respiratory support strategy of severe acute respiratory failure caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in children.\nThe recent ongoing outbreak of severe pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), currently of unknown origin, creates a world emergency that has put global public health institutions on high alert. At present there is limited clinical information of the SARS-CoV-2 and there is no specific treatment recommended, although technical guidances and suggestions have been developed and will continue to be updated as additional information becomes available. Preventive treatment has an important role to control and avoid the spread of severe respiratory disease, but often is difficult to obtain and sometimes cannot be effective to reduce the risk of deterioration of the underlining lung pathology. In order to define an effective and safe treatment for SARS-CoV-2-associated disease, we provide considerations on the actual treatments, on how to avoid complications and the undesirable side effects related to them and to select and apply earlier the most appropriate treatment. Approaching to treat severe respiratory disease in infants and children, the risks related to the development of atelectasis starting invasive or non-invasive ventilation support and the risk of oxygen toxicity must be taken into serious consideration. For an appropriate and effective approach to treat severe pediatric respiratory diseases, two main different strategies can be proposed according to the stage and severity of the patient conditions: patient in the initial phase and with non-severe lung pathology and patient with severe initial respiratory impairment and/or with delay in arrival to observation. The final outcome is strictly connected with the ability to apply an appropriate treatment early and to reduce all the complications that can arise during the intensive care admission.",
   "Structural and molecular modelling studies reveal a new mechanism of action of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nThe recent emergence of the novel pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for a worldwide pandemic. Given the global health emergency, drug repositioning is the most reliable option to design an efficient therapy for infected patients without delay. The first step of the viral replication cycle [i.e. attachment to the surface of respiratory cells, mediated by the spike (S) viral protein] offers several potential therapeutic targets. The S protein uses the angiotension-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor for entry, but also sialic acids linked to host cell surface gangliosides. Using a combination of structural and molecular modelling approaches, this study showed that chloroquine (CLQ), one of the drugs currently under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 treatment, binds sialic acids and gangliosides with high affinity. A new type of ganglioside-binding domain at the tip of the N-terminal domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was identified. This domain (111-158), which is fully conserved among clinical isolates worldwide, may improve attachment of the virus to lipid rafts and facilitate contact with the ACE-2 receptor. This study showed that, in the presence of CLQ [or its more active derivative, hydroxychloroquine (CLQ-OH)], the viral S protein is no longer able to bind gangliosides. The identification of this new mechanism of action of CLQ and CLQ-OH supports the use of these repositioned drugs to cure patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The in-silico approaches used in this study might also be used to assess the efficiency of a broad range of repositioned and/or innovative drug candidates before clinical evaluation.",

In light of its high transmissibility and large burden on the health care system, many hospitals and practices have opted to cancel elective surgeries in order to mobilize resources, ration personal protective equipment and guard patients from the virus. Head and neck cancer physicians are particularly affected by these changes given their scope of practice, complex patient population, and interventional focus. In this viewpoint, we discuss some of the many challenges faced by head and neck surgeons in this climate.

   "Sex-Specific SARS-CoV-2 Mortality: Among Hormone-Modulated ACE2 Expression, Risk of Venous Thromboembolism and Hypovitaminosis D.\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) appears to have a higher mortality rate in presence of comorbidities and in men. The latter suggests the presence of a possible sex-dependent susceptibility. An enzymatic system involved in this different predisposition could be represented by angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is activated and down-regulated by the spike protein of the virus and allows the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into epithelial cells and myocardium. Data on the experimental animal have shown that 17\u00df-estradiol increases the expression and activity of ACE2 in both adipose tissue and kidney. Spontaneously hypertensive male mice have a higher myocardial ACE2 expression than females and its levels decrease after orchiectomy. In addition to this first aspect, the recent evidence of an increased frequency of venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 (a clinical element associated with a worse prognosis) calls the attention on the safety of treatment with testosterone, in particular in hypogonadal men with greater genetic predisposition. Evidence that sex hormones are able to modulate the expression of ACE2 could help in interpreting epidemiological results and in designing more appropriate intervention strategies. Moreover, the vitamin D deficiency in elderly men may be worthy of further study regarding the epidemiological aspects of this different susceptibility and lethality between sexes.",

Face-to-face communication and consistent exposure to body fluids such as blood and saliva predispose dental care workers at serious risk for 2019-nCoV infection. As demonstrated by the recent coronavirus outbreak, information is not enough. During dental practice, blood and saliva can be scattered. Accordingly, dental practice can be a potential risk for dental staff, and there is a high risk of cross-infection.

   "A method to prevent SARS-CoV-2 IgM false positives in gold immunochromatography and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.\nObjective: To investigate the interference factors that lead to false-positive novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) IgM detected using gold immunochromatography assay (GICA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the corresponding solutions.Methods: GICA and ELISA were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgM in 86 serum samples, including 5 influenza A virus (Flu A) IgM-positive sera, 5 influenza B virus (Flu B) IgM-positive sera, 5 Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM-positive sera, 5 Legionella pneumophila IgM-positive sera, 6 sera of HIV infection patients, 36 rheumatoid factor IgM (RF-IgM)-positive sera, 5 sera from hypertensive patients, 5 sera from diabetes mellitus patients, and 14 sera from novel coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19) patients. The interference factors causing false-positive reactivity in the two methods were analyzed, and the urea dissociation test was employed to dissociate the SARS-CoV-2 IgM-positive serum using the best dissociation concentration.Results: Two methods detected positive SARS-CoV-2 IgM in 22 middle-high level RF-IgM-positive sera and 14 sera from COVID-19 patients; the other 50 sera were negative. When urea dissociation concentration was 6 mol/L, SARS-CoV-2 IgM were positive in 1 middle-high level RF-IgM-positive sera and in 14 COVID-19 patient sera detected using GICA. When urea dissociation concentration was 4 mol/L and the avidity index (AI) lower than 0.371 was set to negative, SARS-CoV-2 IgM were positive in 3 middle-high level RF-IgM-positive sera and in 14 COVID-19 patient sera detected using ELISA.Conclusion: Middle-high level of RF-IgM could lead to false-positive reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 IgM detected using GICA and ELISA, and urea dissociation tests would be helpful in reducing false-positive results of SARS-CoV-2 IgM.",
   "[Anesthesia and intensive care ventilators: differences and usability in COVID-19 patients].\nThe current coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemia is a highly dynamic situation characterized by therapeutic and logistic uncertainties. Depending on the effectiveness of social distancing, a shortage of intensive care respirators must be expected. Concomitantly, many physicians and nursing staff are unaware of the capabilities of alternative types of ventilators, hence being unsure if they can be used in intensive care patients. Intensive care respirators were specifically developed for the use in patients with pathological lung mechanics. Nevertheless, modern anesthesia machines offer similar technical capabilities including a number of different modes. However, conceptual differences must be accounted for, requiring close monitoring and the presence of trained personnel. Modern transport ventilators are mainly for bridging purposes as they can only be used with 100% oxygen in contaminated surroundings. Unconventional methods, such as \"ventilator-splitting\", which have recently received increasing attention on social media, cannot be recommended. This review intends to provide an overview of the conceptual and technical differences of different types of mechanical ventilators.",
   "SARS-CoV-2 spread in Northern Italy: what about the pollution role?\nThe recent epidemic of the new SARS-CoV-2 in the northern regions of Italy is putting the organization of the Italian health system under serious attack. The current emergency requires all possible efforts to stem the spread of the virus. In this context, it is clear that we have the urgent need to rely upon etiopathogenetic data, in order to do all possible efforts to block the epidemic. However, observing the trend of the infections in China and the geographic areas of the main outbreaks, it could be hypothesized that air pollution plays a role. In particular, it has been previously demonstrated, in specific populations, a role of particulate matter in worsening clinical presentation of virus infection in airways. Without prejudice to the ascertained virus spread by air droplets or contaminated surfaces, the factors that could have favored its spread remain to be investigated. Moreover, if these observations were to be confirmed, when the health emergency is resolved, it will be mandatory to redesign an economic-productive model in balance with the environment.",
   "A Case for Participatory Disease Surveillance of the COVID-19 Pandemic in India.\nThe coronavirus disease pandemic requires the deployment of novel surveillance strategies to curtail further spread of the disease in the community. Participatory disease surveillance mechanisms have already been adopted in countries for the current pandemic. India, with scarce resources, good telecom support, and a not-so-robust heath care system, makes a strong case for introducing participatory disease surveillance for the prevention and control of the pandemic. India has just launched Aarogya Setu, which is a first-of-its-kind participatory disease surveillance initiative in India. This will supplement the existing Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme in India by finding missing cases and having faster aggregation, analysis of data, and prompt response measures. This newly created platform empowers communities with the right information and guidance, enabling protection from infection and reducing unnecessary contact with the overburdened health care system. However, caution needs to be exercised to address participation from digitally isolated populations, ensure the reliability of data, and consider ethical concerns such as maintaining individual privacy.",

   "Preparedness and Lessons Learned from the Novel Coronavirus Disease.\nIn a short span, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has captured global consciousness by significantly affecting the day-to-day life of humans and emerged as a public health emergency. Undoubtedly, it indicates that lessons learnt from the past epidemics of coronaviruses such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), had not enough and thus left us ill-prepared to deal with the challenges that COVID-19 pandemic is currently posing. Currently, as a global pandemic, COVID-19 poses major challenges and thus forcing the entire world to lockdown. However, the disease has prepared humankind in facing such outbreaks at present as well as in the future. Besides, it has also taught numerous lessons that are worth considering and implementing to make the world a better reality.",
   "Fatal outcome in a liver transplant recipient with COVID-19.\nLiver injury is common in patients with COVID-19, but little is known about its clinical presentation and severity in the context of liver transplant. We describe a case of COVID-19 in a patient who underwent transplant 3\u00a0years ago for hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient came to clinic with symptoms of respiratory disease; pharyngeal swabs for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were positive. His disease progressed rapidly from mild to critical illness and was complicated by several nosocomial infections and multiorgan failure. Despite multiple invasive procedures and rescue therapies, he died from the disease. The management of COVID-19 in the posttransplant setting presents complex challenges, emphasizing the importance of strict prevention strategies.",
   "Perceptions of the adult US population regarding the novel coronavirus outbreak.\nThe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is spreading globally. Although COVID-19 has now been declared a pandemic and risk for infection in the United States (US) is currently high, at the time of survey administration the risk of infection in the US was low. It is important to understand the public perception of risk and trust in sources of information to better inform public health messaging. In this study, we surveyed the adult US population to understand their risk perceptions about the COVID-19 outbreak. We used an online platform to survey 718 adults in the US in early February 2020 using a questionnaire that we developed. Our sample was fairly similar to the general adult US population in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity and education. We found that 69% of the respondents wanted the scientific/public health leadership (either the CDC Director or NIH Director) to lead the US response to COVID-19 outbreak as compared to 14% who wanted the political leadership (either the president or Congress) to lead the response. Risk perception was low (median score of 5 out of 10) with the respondents trusting health professionals and health officials for information on COVID-19. The majority of respondents were in favor of strict infection prevention policies to control the outbreak. Given our results, the public health/scientific leadership should be at the forefront of the COVID-19 response to promote trust.",

   "Can melatonin reduce the severity of COVID-19 pandemic?\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most devastating events in recent history. The virus causes relatively minor damage to young, healthy populations, imposing life-threatening danger to the elderly and people with diseases of chronic inflammation. Therefore, if we could reduce the risk for vulnerable populations, it would make the COVID-19 pandemic more similar to other typical outbreaks. Children don't suffer from COVID-19 as much as their grandparents and have a much higher melatonin level. Bats are nocturnal animals possessing high levels of melatonin, which may contribute to their high anti-viral resistance. Viruses induce an explosion of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, and melatonin is the best natural antioxidant that is lost with age. The programmed cell death coronaviruses cause, which can result in significant lung damage, is also inhibited by melatonin. Coronavirus causes inflammation in the lungs which requires inflammasome activity. Melatonin blocks these inflammasomes. General immunity is impaired by anxiety and sleep deprivation. Melatonin improves sleep habits, reduces anxiety and stimulates immunity. Fibrosis may be the most dangerous complication after COVID-19. Melatonin is known to prevent fibrosis. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary but yet imposes risks due to oxidative stress, which can be reduced by melatonin. Thus, by using the safe over-the-counter drug melatonin, we may be immediately able to prevent the development of severe disease symptoms in coronavirus patients, reduce the severity of their symptoms, and/or reduce the immuno-pathology of coronavirus infection on patients' health after the active phase of the infection is over.",

Herein, an effort was made to identify commercially available drugs in order to repurpose them against coronavirus by the means of structure-based virtual screening. In addition, ZINC15 library was used to identify novel leads against main proteases. Human TMPRSS2 3D structure was first generated using homology modeling approach. Our molecular docking study showed four potential inhibitors against Mpro enzyme, two available drugs (Talampicillin and Lurasidone) and two novel drug-like compounds (ZINC000000702323 and ZINC000012481889). Moreover, four promising inhibitors were identified against TMPRSS2; Rubitecan and Loprazolam drugs, and compounds ZINC000015988935 and ZINC000103558522.

   "Specific ACE2 Expression in Small Intestinal Enterocytes may Cause Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Injury after 2019-nCoV Infection.\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread in other countries in December 2019. The infected patients presented with fever, respiratory symptoms, sometimes with digestive and other systemic manifestations, and some progressed with a severe acute respiratory syndrome or even death. Associated digestive symptoms were frequently observed in the patients, with an unknown significance and mechanism. ACE2, as the major known functional receptor of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) attracted our attention. We collected the clinical data of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients from published studies and extracted the data about the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Furthermore, we used online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs, especially in the small intestine, to explore the relationship between ACE2 expression patterns and clinical symptoms. We found that diarrhea accounted for a notable proportion of COVID-19 patients, ranging from 8.0% to 12.9%. The results reveal that ACE2 mRNA and protein are highly expressed in the small intestinal enterocytes but not in the goblet cells or intestinal immune cells. High expression of ACE2 on the surface cells in the digestive tract may lead to gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation susceptibility. Overall, digestive symptoms were common in the COVID-19 patients. ACE2 expression on surface cells of the small intestine may mediate the invasion and amplification of the virus and activation of gastrointestinal inflammation. It is a possible mechanism of digestive symptoms in the COVID-19 patients and explains the presence of the virus in patients' stool samples. The study also highlights the necessity of taking stool samples for suspected patients to help in early diagnosis and assessment of disease status.",

   "Fear and Practice Modifications among Dentists to Combat Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak.\nAn outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China has influenced every aspect of life. Healthcare professionals, especially dentists, are exposed to a higher risk of getting infected due to close contact with infected patients. The current study was conducted to assess anxiety and fear of getting infected among dentists while working during the current novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) outbreak. In addition, dentists' knowledge about various practice modifications to combat COVID-19 has been evaluated. A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey from 10th to 17th March 2020. The well-constructed questionnaire was designed and registered at online website (Kwiksurveys) and validated. A total of 669 participants from 30 different countries across the world responded. After scrutiny, completed questionnaires (n = 650) were included in the study. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 25. Chi-Square and Spearman correlation tests were applied to control confounders and assess the relation of dentists' response with respect to gender and educational level. More than two-thirds of the general dental practitioners (78%) from 30 countries questioned were anxious and scared by the devastating effects of COVID-19. A large number of dentists (90%) were aware of recent changes in the treatment protocols. However, execution of amended treatment protocol was recorded as 61%. The majority of the dentists (76%) were working in the hospital setting out of which 74% were from private, and 20% were from government setups. Individually we received a large number of responses from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, but collectively more than 50% of the responses were from other parts of the world. Despite having a high standard of knowledge and practice, dental practitioners around the globe are in a state of anxiety and fear while working in their respective fields due to the COVID-19 pandemic impact on humanity. A number of dental practices have either modified their services according to the recommended guidelines to emergency treatment only or closed down practices for an uncertain period.",
   "The effect of normalization of Partial Directed Coherence on the statistical assessment of connectivity patterns: a simulation study.\nPartial Directed Coherence (PDC) is a spectral multivariate estimator for effective connectivity, relying on the concept of Granger causality. Even if its original definition derived directly from information theory, two modifies were introduced in order to provide better physiological interpretations of the estimated networks: i) normalization of the estimator according to rows, ii) squared transformation. In the present paper we investigated the effect of PDC normalization on the performances achieved by applying the statistical validation process on investigated connectivity patterns under different conditions of Signal to Noise ratio (SNR) and amount of data available for the analysis. Results of the statistical analysis revealed an effect of PDC normalization only on the percentages of type I and type II errors occurred by using Shuffling procedure for the assessment of connectivity patterns. No effects of the PDC formulation resulted on the performances achieved during the validation process executed instead by means of Asymptotic Statistic approach. Moreover, the percentages of both false positives and false negatives committed by Asymptotic Statistic are always lower than those achieved by Shuffling procedure for each type of normalization.",
   "Altered resting-state functional connectivity in adolescents is associated with PTSD symptoms and trauma exposure.\nAlterations in resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) have been demonstrated in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). However, such reports have primarily focused on adult participants, whereas findings in adolescents with PTSD are mixed and not entirely consistent with the adult literature. Here, we examined rsFC in a non-treatment seeking adolescent sample with posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS; n\u00a0=\u00a059) relative to asymptomatic controls (n\u00a0=\u00a0226). We also examined differences between trauma-exposed and non-exposed control subgroups (TEC n\u00a0=\u00a073 and Non-TEC n\u00a0=\u00a0153) to examine alterations associated with more general trauma exposure. Finally, we compared the PTSS and TEC groups, to confirm that the reported alterations in PTSS were not driven by trauma exposure. Using a seed-based approach, we examined connectivity of default-mode (DMN) and salience (SN) networks, where alterations have been previously reported. Results suggest that PTSS are associated with less within-DMN connectivity and greater SN-DMN connectivity, as well as altered connectivity with attention regions. Trauma exposure is associated with greater within-SN connectivity. Additionally, we report findings from exploratory connectome-based analysis, which demonstrate a number of topological alterations within DMN in the PTSS group. Overall, our findings replicate prior reports of altered rsFC in PTSD and extend them to non-treatment seeking, trauma-exposed adolescents, who did or did not report PTSS. They specifically highlight SN-DMN desegregation, lower within-DMN and greater within-SN connectivity, as well as altered connectivity with attention regions, in trauma-exposed adolescents. Future research is required to confirm that adolescents with diagnosed PTSD have similar/exacerbated connectivity patterns.",

The connections of the limbic system are widespread and are now becoming visible on diffusion tensor imaging. Many different diseases may affect the limbic system. An appreciation of its functional anatomy along with its white matter tract connections improves assessment of infiltrative disease in particular.

   "High-resolution directed human connectomes and the Consensus Connectome Dynamics.\nHere we show a method of directing the edges of the connectomes, prepared from HARDI datasets from the human brain. Before the present work, no high-definition directed braingraphs were published, because the tractography methods in use are not capable of assigning directions to the neural tracts discovered. Previous work on the functional connectomes applied low-resolution functional MRI-detected statistical causality for the assignment of directions of connectomes of typically several dozens of vertices. Our method is based on the phenomenon of the \"Consensus Connectome Dynamics\", described earlier by our research group. In this contribution, we apply the method to the 423 braingraphs, each with 1015 vertices, computed from the public release of the Human Connectome Project, and we also made the directed connectomes publicly available at the site http://braingraph.org. We also show the robustness of our edge directing method in four independently chosen connectome datasets: we have found that 86% of the edges, which were present in all four datasets, get the same directions in all datasets; therefore the direction method is robust. While our new edge-directing method still needs more empirical validation, we think that our present contribution opens up new possibilities in the analysis of the high-definition human connectome.",
   "Moving in time: Simulating how neural circuits enable rhythmic enactment of planned sequences.\nMany complex actions are mentally pre-composed as plans that specify orderings of simpler actions. To be executed accurately, planned orderings must become active in working memory, and then enacted one-by-one until the sequence is complete. Examples include writing, typing, and speaking. In cases where the planned complex action is musical in nature (e.g. a choreographed dance or a piano melody), it appears to be possible to deploy two learned sequences at the same time, one composed from actions and a second composed from the time intervals between actions. Despite this added complexity, humans readily learn and perform rhythm-based action sequences. Notably, people can learn action sequences and rhythmic sequences separately, and then combine them with little trouble (Ull\u00e9n & Bengtsson 2003). Related functional MRI data suggest that there are distinct neural regions responsible for the two different sequence types (Bengtsson et al. 2004). Although research on musical rhythm is extensive, few computational models exist to extend and inform our understanding of its neural bases. To that end, this article introduces the TAMSIN (Timing And Motor System Integration Network) model, a systems-level neural network model capable of performing arbitrary item sequences in accord with any rhythmic pattern that can be represented as a sequence of integer multiples of a base interval. In TAMSIN, two Competitive Queuing (CQ) modules operate in parallel. One represents and controls item order (the ORD module) and the second represents and controls the sequence of inter-onset-intervals (IOIs) that define a rhythmic pattern (RHY module). Further circuitry helps these modules coordinate their signal processing to enable performative output consistent with a desired beat and tempo.",
   "The Lifespan Human Connectome Project in Aging: An overview.\nThe original Human Connectome Project yielded a rich data set on structural and functional connectivity in a large sample of healthy young adults using improved methods of data acquisition, analysis, and sharing. More recent efforts are extending this approach to include infants, children, older adults, and brain disorders. This paper introduces and describes the Human Connectome Project in Aging (HCP-A), which is currently recruiting 1200\u00a0+\u00a0healthy adults aged 36 to 100+, with a subset of 600\u00a0+\u00a0participants returning for longitudinal assessment. Four acquisition sites using matched Siemens Prisma 3T MRI scanners with centralized quality control and data analysis are enrolling participants. Data are acquired across multimodal imaging and behavioral domains with a focus on factors known to be altered in advanced aging. MRI acquisitions include structural (whole brain and high resolution hippocampal) plus multiband resting state functional (rfMRI), task fMRI (tfMRI), diffusion MRI (dMRI), and arterial spin labeling (ASL). Behavioral characterization includes cognitive (such as processing speed and episodic memory), psychiatric, metabolic, and socioeconomic measures as well as assessment of systemic health (with a focus on menopause via hormonal assays). This dataset will provide a unique resource for examining how brain organization and connectivity changes across typical aging, and how these differences relate to key characteristics of aging including alterations in hormonal status and declining memory and general cognition. A primary goal of the HCP-A is to make these data freely available to the scientific community, supported by the Connectome Coordination Facility (CCF) platform for data quality assurance, preprocessing and basic analysis, and shared via the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). Here we provide the rationale for our study design and sufficient details of the resource for scientists to plan future analyses of these data. A companion paper describes the related Human Connectome Project in Development (HCP-D, Somerville et\u00a0al., 2018), and the image acquisition protocol common to both studies (Harms et\u00a0al., 2018).",
   "[Diffusion formation and psychiatric diseases].\nThe basic principle behind diffusion is Brownian motion. The diffusion parameters obtained in a clinical association provide information on the spatial distribution of water molecule mobility and, therefore, evidence of the morphological integrity of the white and grey matters of the brain. In recent years functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) could contribute to obtaining a detailed understanding of the cortical and subcortical cerebral networks. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) investigations can demonstrate the extent of anisotropy and the fiber pathways in so-called parametric images. For example, in Alzheimer's disease DTI reveals a reduced structural connectivity between the posterior cingulum and the hippocampus. This article shows examples of the application of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in psychiatric disorders.",
   "Coupled symmetric and asymmetric circuits underlying spatial orientation in fruit flies.\nMaintaining spatial orientation when carrying out goal-directed movements requires an animal to perform angular path integration. Such functionality has been recently demonstrated in the ellipsoid body (EB) of fruit flies, though the precise circuitry and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We analyze recently published cellular-level connectomic data and identify the unique characteristics of the EB circuitry, which features coupled symmetric and asymmetric rings. By constructing a spiking neural circuit model based on the connectome, we reveal that the symmetric ring initiates a feedback circuit that sustains persistent neural activity to encode information regarding spatial orientation, while the asymmetric rings are capable of integrating the angular path when the body rotates in the dark. The present model reproduces several key features of EB activity and makes experimentally testable predictions, providing new insight into how spatial orientation is maintained and tracked at the cellular level.Ellipsoid body (EB) neurons in the fruit fly represent the animal heading through a bump-like activity dynamics. Here the authors report a connectome-driven spiking neural circuit model of the EB and the protocerebral bridge (PB) that can maintain and update an activity bump related to the spatial orientation.",
   "Individual variability in the anatomical distribution of nodes participating in rich club structural networks.\nWith recent advances in computational analyses of structural neuroimaging, it is possible to comprehensively map neural connectivity, i.e., the brain connectome. The architectural organization of the connectome is believed to play an important role in several biological processes. Central to the conformation of the connectome are connectivity hubs, which are likely to be organized in accordance with the rich club phenomenon, as evidenced by graph theory analyses of neural architecture. It is yet unclear whether rich club connectivity hubs are consistently organized in the same anatomical framework across healthy adults. We constructed the brain connectome from 43 healthy adults, based on T1-weighted and diffusion tensor MRI data. Probabilistic fiber tractography was used to evaluate connectivity between each possible pair of cortical anatomical regions of interest. Connectivity hubs were identified in accordance with the rich club phenomenon applied to binarized matrices, and the variability in frequency of hub participation was assessed node-wise across all subjects. The anatomical location of nodes participating in rich club networks was fairly consistent across subjects. The most common locations for rich club nodes were identified in integrative areas, such as the cingulate and pericingulate regions, medial aspect of the occipital areas and precuneus; or else, they were found in important and specialized brain regions (such as the oribitofrontal cortex, caudate, fusiform gyrus, and hippocampus). Marked anatomical consistency exists across healthy brains in terms of nodal participation and location of rich club networks. The consistency of connections between integrative areas and specialized brain regions highlights a fundamental connectivity pattern shared among healthy brains. We propose that approaching brain connectivity with this framework of anatomical consistencies may have clinical implications for early detection of individual variability.",
   "Association between resting-state coactivation in the parieto-frontal network and intelligence during late childhood and adolescence.\nA number of studies have associated the adult intelligence quotient with the structure and function of the bilateral parieto-frontal networks, whereas the relationship between intelligence quotient and parieto-frontal network function has been found to be relatively weak in early childhood. Because both human intelligence and brain function undergo protracted development into adulthood, the purpose of the present study was to provide a better understanding of the development of the parieto-frontal network-intelligence quotient relationship.",
   "Parallel visual circuitry in a basal chordate.\nA common CNS architecture is observed in all chordates, from vertebrates to basal chordates like the ascidian Ciona. Ciona stands apart among chordates in having a complete larval connectome. Starting with visuomotor circuits predicted by the Ciona connectome, we used expression maps of neurotransmitter use with behavioral assays to identify two parallel visuomotor circuits that are responsive to different components of visual stimuli. The first circuit is characterized by glutamatergic photoreceptors and responds to the direction of light. These photoreceptors project to cholinergic motor neurons, via two tiers of cholinergic interneurons. The second circuit responds to changes in ambient light and mediates an escape response. This circuit uses GABAergic photoreceptors which project to GABAergic interneurons, and then to cholinergic interneurons. Our observations on the behavior of larvae either treated with a GABA receptor antagonist or carrying a mutation that eliminates photoreceptors indicate the second circuit is disinhibitory.",
   "Partial Least Squares Regression Performs Well in MRI-Based Individualized Estimations.\nEstimation of individuals' cognitive, behavioral and demographic (CBD) variables based on MRI has attracted much research interest in the past decade, and effective machine learning techniques are of great importance for these estimations. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) is an attractive machine learning technique that can accommodate both single- and multi-label learning in a simple framework, while its potential for MRI-based estimations of CBD variables remains to be explored. In this study, we systemically investigated the performance of PLSR in MRI-based estimations of individuals' CBD variables, especially its performance in simultaneous estimation of multiple CBD variables (multi-label learning). We performed the study on the dataset included in the HCP S1200 release. Resting state functional connections (RSFCs) were used as features, and a total of 10 CBD variables (e.g., age, gender, grip strength, and picture vocabulary) were estimated. The results showed that PLSR performed well in both single- and multi-label learning. In fact, the present estimations were better than those reported in literatures, as indicated by stronger correlations between the estimated and actual CBD variables, as well as high gender classification accuracy (97.8% in this study). Moreover, the RSFCs that contributed to the estimations exhibited strong correlations with the CBD variable estimated, that is, PLSR algorithm automatically selected the RSFCs closely related to one CBD variable to establish predictive models for the variable. Besides, the estimation accuracies based on RSFCs among 100, 200, and 300 regions of interest (ROIs) were higher than those based on RSFCs among 15, 25, and 50 ROIs; the estimation accuracies based on RSFCs evaluated using partial correlation were higher than those based on RSFCs evaluated using full correlation. In addition to the aforementioned virtues, PLSR is efficient in model training and testing, and it is simple and easy to use. Therefore, PLSR can be a favorable choice for future MRI-based estimations of CBD variables.",
   "Individual differences in functional connectivity during naturalistic viewing conditions.\nNaturalistic viewing paradigms such as movies have been shown to reduce participant head motion and improve arousal during fMRI scanning relative to task-free rest, and have been used to study both functional connectivity and stimulus-evoked BOLD-signal changes. These task-based hemodynamic changes are synchronized across subjects and involve large areas of the cortex, and it is unclear whether individual differences in functional connectivity are enhanced or diminished under such naturalistic conditions. This work first aims to characterize variability in BOLD-signal based functional connectivity (FC) across 2 distinct movie conditions and eyes-open rest (n=31 healthy adults, 2 scan sessions each). We found that movies have higher within- and between-subject correlations in cluster-wise FC relative to rest. The anatomical distribution of inter-individual variability was similar across conditions, with higher variability occurring at the lateral prefrontal lobes and temporoparietal junctions. Second, we used an unsupervised test-retest matching algorithm that identifies individual subjects from within a group based on FC patterns, quantifying the accuracy of the algorithm across the three conditions. The movies and resting state all enabled identification of individual subjects based on FC matrices, with accuracies between 61% and 100%. Overall, pairings involving movies outperformed rest, and the social, faster-paced movie attained 100% accuracy. When the parcellation resolution, scan duration, and number of edges used were increased, accuracies improved across conditions, and the pattern of movies>rest was preserved. These results suggest that using dynamic stimuli such as movies enhances the detection of FC patterns that are unique at the individual level.",
   "Interactions of HIV and drugs of abuse: the importance of glia, neural progenitors, and host genetic factors.\nConsiderable insight has been gained into the comorbid, interactive effects of HIV and drug abuse in the brain using experimental models. This review, which considers opiates, methamphetamine, and cocaine, emphasizes the importance of host genetics and glial plasticity in driving the pathogenic neuron remodeling underlying neuro-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and drug abuse comorbidity. Clinical findings are less concordant than experimental work, and the response of individuals to HIV and to drug abuse can vary tremendously. Host-genetic variability is important in determining viral tropism, neuropathogenesis, drug responses, and addictive behavior. However, genetic differences alone cannot account for individual variability in the brain \"connectome.\" Environment and experience are critical determinants in the evolution of synaptic circuitry throughout life. Neurons and glia both exercise control over determinants of synaptic plasticity that are disrupted by HIV and drug abuse. Perivascular macrophages, microglia, and to a lesser extent astroglia can harbor the infection. Uninfected bystanders, especially astroglia, propagate and amplify inflammatory signals. Drug abuse by itself derails neuronal and glial function, and the outcome of chronic exposure is maladaptive plasticity. The negative consequences of coexposure to HIV and drug abuse are determined by numerous factors including genetics, sex, age, and multidrug exposure. Glia and some neurons are generated throughout life, and their progenitors appear to be targets of HIV and opiates/psychostimulants. The chronic nature of HIV and drug abuse appears to result in sustained alterations in the maturation and fate of neural progenitors, which may affect the balance of glial populations within multiple brain regions.",
   "Estimating changing contexts in schizophrenia.\nSEE STEPHAN ET AL DOI101093/AWW120 FOR A SCIENTIFIC COMMENTARY ON THIS WORK: Real world information is often abstract, dynamic and imprecise. Deciding if changes represent random fluctuations, or alterations in underlying contexts involve challenging probability estimations. Dysfunction may contribute to erroneous beliefs, such as delusions. Here we examined brain function during inferences about context change from noisy information. We examined cortical-subcortical circuitry engaging anterior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and midbrain. We hypothesized that schizophrenia-related deficits in prefrontal function might overestimate context change probabilities, and that this more chaotic worldview may subsequently gain familiarity and be over-reinforced, with implications for delusions. We then examined these opposing information processing biases against less expected versus familiar information patterns in relation to genetic risk for schizophrenia in unaffected siblings. In one experiment, 17 patients with schizophrenia and 24 normal control subjects were presented in 3 T magnetic resonance imaging with numerical information varying noisily about a context integer, which occasionally shifted up or down. Subjects were to indicate when the inferred numerical context had changed. We fitted Bayesian models to estimate probabilities associated with change inferences. Dynamic causal models examined cortical-subcortical circuitry interactions at context change inference, and at subsequent reduced uncertainty. In a second experiment, genetic risk for schizophrenia associated with similar cortical-subcortical findings were explored in an independent sample of 36 normal control subjects and 35 unaffected siblings during processing of intuitive number sequences along the number line, or during the inverse, less familiar, sequence. In the first experiment, reduced Bayesian models fitting subject behaviour suggest that patients with schizophrenia overestimated context change probabilities. Here, patients engaged anterior prefrontal cortex relatively less than healthy controls, in part driven by reduced effective connectivity from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to anterior prefrontal cortex. In processing subsequent information indicating reduced uncertainty of their predictions, patients engaged relatively increased mid-brain activation, driven in part by increased dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to midbrain connectivity. These dissociable reduced and exaggerated prefrontal and subcortical circuit functions were accentuated in patients with delusions. In the second experiment, analogous dissociable reduced anterior prefrontal cortex and exaggerated midbrain engagement occurred in unaffected siblings when processing less expected versus more familiar number sequences. In conclusion, patients overestimated ambiguous context change probabilities with relatively reduced anterior frontal engagement. Subsequent reduced uncertainty about contextual state appeared over-reinforced, potentially contributing to confirmation bias and a cascade of aberrant belief processing about a more chaotic world relevant to delusions. These opposing cortical-subcortical effects relate in part to genetic risk for schizophrenia, with analogous imbalances in neural processing of less expected versus familiar information patterns.",
   "Transmodal Learning of Functional Networks for Alzheimer's Disease Prediction.\nFunctional connectivity describes neural activity from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). This noninvasive modality is a promising imaging biomarker of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), where the connectome can be an indicator to assess and to understand the pathology. However, it only provides noisy measurements of brain activity. As a consequence, it has shown fairly limited discrimination power on clinical groups. So far, the reference functional marker of AD is the fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). It gives a reliable quantification of metabolic activity, but it is costly and invasive. Here, our goal is to analyze AD populations solely based on rs-fMRI, as functional connectivity is correlated to metabolism. We introduce transmodal learning: leveraging a prior from one modality to improve results of another modality on different subjects. A metabolic prior is learned from an independent FDG-PET dataset to improve functional connectivity-based prediction of AD. The prior acts as a regularization of connectivity learning and improves the estimation of discriminative patterns from distinct rs-fMRI datasets. Our approach is a two-stage classification strategy that combines several seed-based connectivity maps to cover a large number of functional networks that identify AD physiopathology. Experimental results show that our transmodal approach increases classification accuracy compared to pure rs-fMRI approaches, without resorting to additional invasive acquisitions. The method successfully recovers brain regions known to be impacted by the disease.",
   "Evaluating the organizational structure and specificity of network topology within the face processing system.\nThere is increasing appreciation that network-level interactions among regions produce components of face processing previously ascribed to individual regions. Our goals were to use an exhaustive data-driven approach to derive and quantify the topology of directed functional connections within a priori defined nodes of the face processing network and evaluate whether the topology is category-specific. Young adults were scanned with fMRI as they viewed movies of faces, objects, and scenes. We employed GIMME to model effective connectivity among core and extended face processing regions, which allowed us to evaluate all possible directional connections, under each viewing condition (face, object, place). During face processing, we observed directional connections from the right posterior superior temporal sulcus to both the right occipital face area and right fusiform face area (FFA), which does not reflect the topology reported in prior studies. We observed connectivity between core and extended regions during face processing, but this limited to a feed-forward connection from the FFA to the amygdala. Finally, the topology of connections was unique to face processing. These findings suggest that the pattern of directed functional connections within the face processing network, particularly in the right core regions, may not be as hierarchical and feed-forward as described previously. Our findings support the notion that topologies of network connections are specialized, emergent, and dynamically responsive to task demands.",
   "A Sparse Bayesian Learning Algorithm for White Matter Parameter Estimation from Compressed Multi-shell Diffusion MRI.\nWe propose a sparse Bayesian learning algorithm for improved estimation of white matter fiber parameters from compressed (under-sampled q-space) multi-shell diffusion MRI data. The multi-shell data is represented in a dictionary form using a non-monoexponential decay model of diffusion, based on continuous gamma distribution of diffusivities. The fiber volume fractions with predefined orientations, which are the unknown parameters, form the dictionary weights. These unknown parameters are estimated with a linear un-mixing framework, using a sparse Bayesian learning algorithm. A localized learning of hyperparameters at each voxel and for each possible fiber orientations improves the parameter estimation. Our experiments using synthetic data from the ISBI 2012 HARDI reconstruction challenge and in-vivo data from the Human Connectome Project demonstrate the improvements.",
   "Common Dysfunction of Large-Scale Neurocognitive Networks Across Psychiatric Disorders.\nCognitive dysfunction is one of the most prominent characteristics of psychiatric disorders. Currently, the neural correlates of cognitive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate functional connectivity and structural perturbations across psychiatric diagnoses in three neurocognitive networks of interest: the default mode network (DMN), the frontoparietal network (FPN), and the salience network (SN).",
   "Plasticity versus stability across the human cortical visual connectome.\nWhether and how the balance between plasticity and stability varies across the brain is an important open question. Within a processing hierarchy, it is thought that plasticity is increased at higher levels of cortical processing, but direct quantitative comparisons between low- and high-level plasticity have not been made so far. Here, we address this issue for the human cortical visual system. We quantify plasticity as the complement of the heritability of resting-state functional connectivity and thereby demonstrate a non-monotonic relationship between plasticity and hierarchical level, such that plasticity decreases from early to mid-level cortex, and then increases further of the visual hierarchy. This non-monotonic relationship argues against recent theory that the balance between plasticity and stability is governed by the costs of the \"coding-catastrophe\", and can be explained by a concurrent decline of short-term adaptation and rise of long-term plasticity up the visual processing hierarchy.",
   "Negative Schizotypy and Altered Functional Connectivity During Facial Emotion Processing.\nImpairment in facial emotion perception is an important domain of social cognition deficits in schizophrenia. Although impaired facial emotion perception has been found in individuals with negative schizotypy (NS), little is known about the corresponding change in brain functional connectivity.",
   "System-level matching of structural and functional connectomes in the human brain.\nThe brain can be considered as an information processing network, where complex behavior manifests as a result of communication between large-scale functional systems such as visual and default mode networks. As the communication between brain regions occurs through underlying anatomical pathways, it is important to define a \"traffic pattern\" that properly describes how the regions exchange information. Empirically, the choice of the traffic pattern can be made based on how well the functional connectivity between regions matches the structural pathways equipped with that traffic pattern. In this paper, we present a multimodal connectomics paradigm utilizing graph matching to measure similarity between structural and functional connectomes (derived from dMRI and fMRI data) at node, system, and connectome level. Through an investigation of the brain's structure-function relationship over a large cohort of 641 healthy developmental participants aged 8-22 years, we demonstrate that communicability as the traffic pattern describes the functional connectivity of the brain best, with large-scale systems having significant agreement between their structural and functional connectivity patterns. Notably, matching between structural and functional connectivity for the functionally specialized modular systems such as visual and motor networks are higher as compared to other more integrated systems. Additionally, we show that the negative functional connectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and motor, frontoparietal, attention, and visual networks is significantly associated with its underlying structural connectivity, highlighting the counterbalance between functional activation patterns of DMN and other systems. Finally, we investigated sex difference and developmental changes in brain and observed that similarity between structure and function changes with development.",

   "Generative models of the human connectome.\nThe human connectome represents a network map of the brain's wiring diagram and the pattern into which its connections are organized is thought to play an important role in cognitive function. The generative rules that shape the topology of the human connectome remain incompletely understood. Earlier work in model organisms has suggested that wiring rules based on geometric relationships (distance) can account for many but likely not all topological features. Here we systematically explore a family of generative models of the human connectome that yield synthetic networks designed according to different wiring rules combining geometric and a broad range of topological factors. We find that a combination of geometric constraints with a homophilic attachment mechanism can create synthetic networks that closely match many topological characteristics of individual human connectomes, including features that were not included in the optimization of the generative model itself. We use these models to investigate a lifespan dataset and show that, with age, the model parameters undergo progressive changes, suggesting a rebalancing of the generative factors underlying the connectome across the lifespan.",
   "Full tractography for detecting the position of cranial nerves in preoperative planning for skull base surgery: technical note.\nDiffusion imaging tractography has allowed the in vivo description of brain white matter. One of its applications is preoperative planning for brain tumor resection. Due to a limited spatial and angular resolution, it is difficult for fiber tracking to delineate fiber crossing areas and small-scale structures, in particular brainstem tracts and cranial nerves. New methods are being developed but these involve extensive multistep tractography pipelines including the patient-specific design of multiple regions of interest (ROIs). The authors propose a new practical full tractography method that could be implemented in routine presurgical planning for skull base surgery.",
   "Degree centrality and fractional amplitude of low-frequency oscillations associated with Stroop interference.\nStroop paradigms are commonly used as an index of attention deficits and a tool for investigating functions of the frontal lobes and other associated structures. Here we investigated the correlation between resting-state functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) measures [degree centrality (DC)/fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFFs)] and Stroop interference. We examined this relationship in the brains of 958 healthy young adults. DC reflects the number of instantaneous functional connections between a region and the rest of the brain within the entire connectivity matrix of the brain (connectome), and thus how much of the node influences the entire brain areas, while fALFF is an indicator of the intensity of regional brain spontaneous activity. Reduced Stroop interference was associated with larger DC in the left lateral prefrontal cortex, left IFJ, and left inferior parietal lobule as well as larger fALFF in the areas of the dorsal attention network and the precuneus. These findings suggest that Stroop performance is reflected in resting state functional properties of these areas and the network. In addition, default brain activity of the dorsal attention network and precuneus as well as higher cognitive processes represented there, and default stronger global influence of the areas critical in executive functioning underlie better Stroop performance.",
   "Bottom up modeling of the connectome: linking structure and function in the resting brain and their changes in aging.\nWith the increasing availability of advanced imaging technologies, we are entering a new era of neuroscience. Detailed descriptions of the complex brain network enable us to map out a structural connectome, characterize it with graph theoretical methods, and compare it to the functional networks with increasing detail. To link these two aspects and understand how dynamics and structure interact to form functional brain networks in task and in the resting state, we use theoretical models. The advantage of using theoretical models is that by recreating functional connectivity and time series explicitly from structure and pre-defined dynamics, we can extract critical mechanisms by linking structure and function in ways not directly accessible in the real brain. Recently, resting-state models with varying local dynamics have reproduced empirical functional connectivity patterns, and given support to the view that the brain works at a critical point at the edge of a bifurcation of the system. Here, we present an overview of a modeling approach of the resting brain network and give an application of a neural mass model in the study of complexity changes in aging.",
   "The Concept of Effective Inflow: Application to Interictal Localization of the Epileptogenic Focus From iEEG.\nAccurate determination of the epileptogenic focus is of paramount diagnostic and therapeutic importance in epilepsy. The current gold standard for focus localization is from ictal (seizure) onset and thus requires the occurrence and recording of multiple typical seizures of a patient. Localization of the focus from seizure-free (interictal) periods remains a challenging problem, especially in the absence of interictal epileptiform activity.",
   "Diffusion MRI microstructure models with in vivo human brain Connectome data: results from a multi-group comparison.\nA large number of mathematical models have been proposed to describe the measured signal in diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, model comparison to date focuses only on specific subclasses, e.g. compartment models or signal models, and little or no information is available in the literature on how performance varies among the different types of models. To address this deficiency, we organized the 'White Matter Modeling Challenge' during the International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2015 conference. This competition aimed to compare a range of different kinds of models in their ability to explain a large range of measurable in vivo DW human brain data. Specifically, we assessed the ability of models to predict the DW signal accurately for new diffusion gradients and b values. We did not evaluate the accuracy of estimated model parameters, as a ground truth is hard to obtain. We used the Connectome scanner at the Massachusetts General Hospital, using gradient strengths of up to 300\u2009mT/m and a broad set of diffusion times. We focused on assessing the DW signal prediction in two regions: the genu in the corpus callosum, where the fibres are relatively straight and parallel, and the fornix, where the configuration of fibres is more complex. The challenge participants had access to three-quarters of the dataset and their models were ranked on their ability to predict the remaining unseen quarter of the data. The challenge provided a unique opportunity for a quantitative comparison of diverse methods from multiple groups worldwide. The comparison of the challenge entries reveals interesting trends that could potentially influence the next generation of diffusion-based quantitative MRI techniques. The first is that signal models do not necessarily outperform tissue models; in fact, of those tested, tissue models rank highest on average. The second is that assuming a non-Gaussian (rather than purely Gaussian) noise model provides little improvement in prediction of unseen data, although it is possible that this may still have a beneficial effect on estimated parameter values. The third is that preprocessing the training data, here by omitting signal outliers, and using signal-predicting strategies, such as bootstrapping or cross-validation, could benefit the model fitting. The analysis in this study provides a benchmark for other models and the data remain available to build up a more complete comparison in the future.",
   "Scale-Dependent Variability and Quantitative Regimes in Graph-Theoretic Representations of Human Cortical Networks.\nStudying brain connectivity is important due to potential differences in brain circuitry between health and disease. One drawback of graph-theoretic approaches to this is that their results are dependent on the spatial scale at which brain circuitry is examined and explicitly on how vertices and edges are defined in network models. To investigate this, magnetic resonance and diffusion tensor images were acquired from 136 healthy adults, and each subject's cortex was parceled into as many as 50,000 regions. Regions were represented as nodes in a reconstructed network representation, and interregional connectivity was inferred via deterministic tractography. Network model behavior was explored as a function of nodal number and connectivity weighing. Three distinct regimes of quantitative behavior assumed by network models as a function of spatial scale are identified, and their existence may be modulated by the spatial folding scale of the cortex. The maximum number of network nodes used to model human brain circuitry in this study (\u223c50,000) is larger than in previous macroscale neuroimaging studies. Results suggest that network model properties vary appreciably as a function of vertex assignment convention and edge weighing scheme and that graph-theoretic analysis results should not be compared across spatial scales without appropriate understanding of how spatial scale and model topology modulate network model properties. These findings have implications for comparing macro- to mesoscale studies of brain network models and understanding how choosing network-theoretic parameters affects the interpretation of brain connectivity studies.",
   "Functional Connectivity-Based Parcellation of the Thalamus: An Unsupervised Clustering Method and Its Validity Investigation.\nNode definition or delineating how the brain is parcellated into individual functionally related regions is the first step to accurately map the human connectome. As a result, parcellation of the human brain has drawn considerable attention in the field of neuroscience. The thalamus is known as a relay in the human brain, with its nuclei sending fibers to the cortical and subcortical regions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques offer a way to parcellate the thalamus in vivo based on its connectivity properties. However, the parcellations from previous studies show that both the number and the distribution of thalamic subdivisions vary with different cortical segmentation methods. In this study, we used an unsupervised clustering method that does not rely on a priori information of the cortical segmentation to parcellate the thalamus. Instead, this approach is based on the intrinsic resting-state functional connectivity profiles of the thalamus with the whole brain. A series of cluster solutions were obtained, and an optimal solution was determined. Furthermore, the validity of our parcellation was investigated through the following: (1) identifying specific resting-state connectivity patterns of thalamic parcels with different brain networks and (2) investigating the task activation and psychophysiological interactions of specific thalamic clusters during 8-Hz flashing checkerboard stimulation with simultaneous finger tapping. Together, the current study provides a reliable parcellation of the thalamus and enhances our understating of thalamic. Furthermore, the current study provides a framework for parcellation that could be potentially extended to other subcortical and cortical regions.",
   "The effect of prior knowledge on post-encoding brain connectivity and its relation to subsequent memory.\nIt is known that prior knowledge can facilitate memory acquisition. It is unclear, however, whether prior knowledge can affect post-encoding brain activity to facilitate memory consolidation. In this fMRI study, we asked participants to associate novel houses with famous/nonfamous faces and investigated how associative-encoding tasks with/without prior knowledge differentially affected post-encoding brain connectivity during rest. Besides memory advantages in the famous condition, we found that post-encoding hippocampal connectivity with the fusiform face area (FFA) and ventral-medial-prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was stronger following encoding of associations with famous than non-famous faces. Importantly, post-encoding functional connectivity between the hippocampus (HPC) and FFA, and between the anterior temporal pole region (aTPL) and posterior perceptual regions (i.e., FFA and the parahippocampal place area), together predicted a large proportion of the variance in subsequent memory performance. This prediction was specific for face-house associative memory, not face/house item memory, and only in the famous condition where prior knowledge was involved. These results support the idea that when prior knowledge is involved, the HPC, vmPFC, and aTPL, which support prior episodic, social-evaluative/schematic, and semantic memories, respectively, continue to interact with each other and posterior perceptual brain regions during the post-encoding rest to facilitate off-line processing of the newly formed memory, and enhance memory consolidation.",
   "Identifying disease foci from static and dynamic effective connectivity networks: Illustration in soldiers with trauma.\nBrain connectivity studies report group differences in pairwise connection strengths. While informative, such results are difficult to interpret since our understanding of the brain relies on region-based properties, rather than on connection information. Given that large disruptions in the brain are often caused by a few pivotal sources, we propose a novel framework to identify the sources of functional disruption from effective connectivity networks. Our approach integrates static and time-varying effective connectivity modeling in a probabilistic framework, to identify aberrant foci and the corresponding aberrant connectomics network. Using resting-state fMRI, we illustrate the utility of this novel approach in U.S. Army soldiers (N\u2009=\u200987) with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and combat controls. Additionally, we employed machine-learning classification to identify those significant connectivity features that possessed high predictive ability. We identified three disrupted foci (middle frontal gyrus [MFG], insula, hippocampus), and an aberrant prefrontal-subcortical-parietal network of information flow. We found the MFG to be the pivotal focus of network disruption, with aberrant strength and temporal-variability of effective connectivity to the insula, amygdala and hippocampus. These connectivities also possessed high predictive ability (giving a classification accuracy of 81%); and they exhibited significant associations with symptom severity and neurocognitive functioning. In summary, dysregulation originating in the MFG caused elevated and temporally less-variable connectivity in subcortical regions, followed by a similar effect on parietal memory-related regions. This mechanism likely contributes to the reduced control over traumatic memories leading to re-experiencing, hyperarousal and flashbacks observed in soldiers with PTSD and mTBI.

   "Intelligence, Cognition, and Language of Green Plants.\nA summary definition of some 70 descriptions of intelligence provides a definition for all other organisms including plants that stresses fitness. Barbara McClintock, a plant biologist, posed the notion of the 'thoughtful cell' in her Nobel prize address. The systems structure necessary for a thoughtful cell is revealed by comparison of the interactome and connectome. The plant root cap, a group of some 200 cells that act holistically in responding to numerous signals, likely possesses a similar systems structure agreeing with Darwin's description of acting like the brain of a lower organism. Intelligent behavior requires assessment of different choices and taking the beneficial one. Decisions are constantly required to optimize the plant phenotype to a dynamic environment and the cambium is the assessing tissue diverting more or removing resources from different shoot and root branches through manipulation of vascular elements. Environmental awareness likely indicates consciousness. Spontaneity in plant behavior, ability to count to five and error correction indicate intention. Volatile organic compounds are used as signals in plant interactions and being complex in composition may be the equivalent of language accounting for self and alien recognition by individual plants. Game theory describes competitive interactions. Interactive and intelligent outcomes emerge from application of various games between plants themselves and interactions with microbes. Behavior profiting from experience, another simple definition of intelligence, requires both learning and memory and is indicated in the priming of herbivory, disease and abiotic stresses.",
   "The dynamics of resting fluctuations in the brain: metastability and its dynamical cortical core.\nIn the human brain, spontaneous activity during resting state consists of rapid transitions between functional network states over time but the underlying mechanisms are not understood. We use connectome based computational brain network modeling to reveal fundamental principles of how the human brain generates large-scale activity observable by noninvasive neuroimaging. We used structural and functional neuroimaging data to construct whole- brain models. With this novel approach, we reveal that the human brain during resting state operates at maximum metastability, i.e. in a state of maximum network switching. In addition, we investigate cortical heterogeneity across areas. Optimization of the spectral characteristics of each local brain region revealed the dynamical cortical core of the human brain, which is driving the activity of the rest of the whole brain. Brain network modelling goes beyond correlational neuroimaging analysis and reveals non-trivial network mechanisms underlying non-invasive observations. Our novel findings significantly pertain to the important role of computational connectomics in understanding principles of brain function.",
   "Theta, mental flexibility, and post-traumatic stress disorder: connecting in the parietal cortex.\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health injury characterised by re-experiencing, avoidance, numbing and hyperarousal. Whilst the aetiology of the disorder is relatively well understood, there is debate about the prevalence of cognitive sequelae that manifest in PTSD. In particular, there are conflicting reports about deficits in executive function and mental flexibility. Even less is known about the neural changes that underlie such deficits. Here, we used magnetoencephalography to study differences in functional connectivity during a mental flexibility task in combat-related PTSD (all males, mean age = 37.4, n = 18) versus a military control (all males, mean age = 33.05, n = 19) group. We observed large-scale increases in theta connectivity in the PTSD group compared to controls. The PTSD group performance was compromised in the more attentionally-demanding task and this was characterised by 'late-stage' theta hyperconnectivity, concentrated in network connections involving right parietal cortex. Furthermore, we observed significant correlations with the connectivity strength in this region with a number of cognitive-behavioural outcomes, including measures of attention, depression and anxiety. These findings suggest atypical coordination of neural synchronisation in large scale networks contributes to deficits in mental flexibility for PTSD populations in timed, attentionally-demanding tasks, and this propensity toward network hyperconnectivity may play a more general role in the cognitive sequelae evident in this disorder.",
   "Reduced small world brain connectivity in probands with a family history of epilepsy.\nThe role of inheritance in ascertaining susceptibility to epilepsy is well established, although the pathogenetic mechanisms are still not very clear. Interviewing for a positive family history is a popular epidemiological tool in the understanding of this susceptibility. Our aim was to visualize and localize network abnormalities that could be associated with a positive family history in a group of patients with hot water epilepsy (HWE) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI).",
   "Individual Differences in Dynamic Functional Brain Connectivity across the Human Lifespan.\nIndividual differences in brain functional networks may be related to complex personal identifiers, including health, age, and ability. Dynamic network theory has been used to identify properties of dynamic brain function from fMRI data, but the majority of analyses and findings remain at the level of the group. Here, we apply hypergraph analysis, a method from dynamic network theory, to quantify individual differences in brain functional dynamics. Using a summary metric derived from the hypergraph formalism-hypergraph cardinality-we investigate individual variations in two separate, complementary data sets. The first data set (\"multi-task\") consists of 77 individuals engaging in four consecutive cognitive tasks. We observe that hypergraph cardinality exhibits variation across individuals while remaining consistent within individuals between tasks; moreover, the analysis of one of the memory tasks revealed a marginally significant correspondence between hypergraph cardinality and age. This finding motivated a similar analysis of the second data set (\"age-memory\"), in which 95 individuals, aged 18-75, performed a memory task with a similar structure to the multi-task memory task. With the increased age range in the age-memory data set, the correlation between hypergraph cardinality and age correspondence becomes significant. We discuss these results in the context of the well-known finding linking age with network structure, and suggest that hypergraph analysis should serve as a useful tool in furthering our understanding of the dynamic network structure of the brain.",
   "Brain connectivity and prediction of relapse after cognitive-behavioral therapy in obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nIntensive cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can effectively reduce symptoms in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, many relapse after treatment. Few studies have investigated biological markers predictive of follow-up clinical status. The objective was to determine if brain network connectivity patterns prior to intensive CBT predict worsening of clinical symptoms during follow-up.",
   "Functionally distinct language and Theory of Mind networks are synchronized at rest and during language comprehension.\nCommunication requires the abilities to generate and interpret utterances and to infer the beliefs, desires, and goals of others (\"Theory of Mind\"; ToM). These two abilities have been shown to dissociate: individuals with aphasia retain the ability to think about others' mental states; and individuals with autism are impaired in social reasoning, but their basic language processing is often intact. In line with this evidence from brain disorders, functional MRI (fMRI) studies have shown that linguistic and ToM abilities recruit distinct sets of brain regions. And yet, language is a social tool that allows us to share thoughts with one another. Thus, the language and ToM brain networks must share information despite being implemented in distinct neural circuits. Here, we investigated potential interactions between these networks during naturalistic cognition using functional correlations in fMRI. The networks were functionally defined in individual participants, in terms of preference for sentences over nonwords for language, and for belief inference over physical-event processing for ToM, with both a verbal and a nonverbal paradigm. Although, across experiments, interregion correlations within each network were higher than between-network correlations, we also observed above-baseline synchronization of blood oxygenation level-dependent signal fluctuations between the two networks during rest and story comprehension. This synchronization was functionally specific: neither network was synchronized with the executive control network (functionally defined in terms of preference for a harder over easier version of an executive task). Thus, coordination between the language and ToM networks appears to be an inherent and specific characteristic of their functional architecture. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Humans differ from nonhuman primates in their abilities to communicate linguistically and to infer others' mental states. Although linguistic and social abilities appear to be interlinked onto- and phylogenetically, they are dissociated in the adult human brain. Yet successful communication requires language and social reasoning to work in concert. Using functional MRI, we show that language regions are synchronized with social regions during rest and language comprehension, pointing to a possible mechanism for internetwork interaction.",
   "Differentially disrupted functional connectivity in posteromedial cortical subregions in Alzheimer's disease.\nNeuroimaging studies have demonstrated that patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have remarkable focal grey matter loss and hypometabolism in the posteromedial cortex (PMC), which is composed of the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex, suggesting an important association of the PMC with AD pathophysiology. Studies have also shown that the PMC is a structurally and functionally heterogeneous structure containing various subregions with distinct connectivity profiles. However, whether these PMC subregions show differentially disrupted connectivity patterns in AD remains largely unknown. Here, we addressed this issue by collecting resting-state functional MRI data from 32 AD patients and 38 healthy controls. We automatically identified the PMC subregions using a graph-based module detection algorithm and then mapped the whole-brain functional connectivity pattern of each subregion. The functional connectivity analysis was followed by a hierarchical clustering analysis to classify each subregion. Three distinct spatial connectivity patterns were observed across the PMC subregions: the anterior dorsal zone was functionally connected with the sensorimotor cortex; the posterior dorsal zone was functionally connected with the frontoparietal cortex; and the central and ventral zones were functionally connected with the default-mode regions. Group comparison analysis revealed that all three functional systems were significantly disrupted in the AD patients compared to the controls and these disruptions were positively correlated with the patients' cognitive performance. Collectively, we showed that the subregions of the PMC exhibit differentially disrupted neuronal circuitry in AD patients, which provides new insight into the functional neuroanatomy of the human PMC and the alterations that may be relevant to disease.",
   "Connecting Mind, Brain, and Seizures by Default Mode.\nEffective Connectivity Within the Default Mode Network in Left Temporal Lobe Epilepsy: Findings From the Epilepsy Connectome Project Cook CJ, Hwang G, Mathis J, et al. Brain Connect. 2018. doi:10.1089/brain.2018.0600. [Epub ahead of print]; PMID: 30398367 The Epilepsy Connectome Project examines the differences in connectomes between patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and healthy controls. Using these data, the effective connectivity of the default mode network (DMN) in patients with left TLE compared to healthy controls was investigated using spectral dynamic causal modeling of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Group comparisons were made using 2 parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) models. The first level of each PEB model consisted of each participant's spectral dynamic causal modeling. Two different second-level models were constructed: the first comparing effective connectivity of the groups directly and the second using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) delayed free recall index as a covariate at the second level in order to assess effective connectivity controlling for the poor memory performance of patients with left TLE. After an automated search over the nested parameter space and thresholding parameters at 95% posterior probability, both models revealed numerous connections in the DMN that lead to inhibition of the left hippocampal formation. Left hippocampal formation inhibition may be an inherent result of the left temporal epileptogenic focus as memory differences were controlled for in one model and the same connections remained. An excitatory connection from the posterior cingulate cortex to the medial prefrontal cortex was found to be concomitant with left hippocampal formation inhibition in patients with TLE when including RAVLT delayed free recall at the second level.",
   "Different interaction modes for the default mode network revealed by resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging.\nThe default mode network (DMN), which, in the resting state, is in charge of both the brain's intrinsic mentation and its reflexive responses to external stimuli, is recognized as an essential network in the human brain. These two roles of mentation and reflexive response recruit the DMN nodes and other task networks differently. Existing research has revealed that the interactions inside the DMN (between nodes within the DMN) and outside the DMN (between nodes in the DMN and nodes in task networks) have different modes, in terms of both strength and timing. These findings raise interesting questions. For example, are the internal and external interactions of the DMN equally linear or nonlinear? This study examined these interaction patterns using datasets from the Human Connectome Project. A maximal information-based nonparametric exploration statistics strategy was utilized to characterize the full correlations, and the Pearson correlation was used to capture the linear component of the full correlations. We then contrasted the level of linearity/nonlinearity with respect to the internal and external interactions of the DMN. After a brain-wide exploration, we found that the interactions between the DMN and the sensorimotor-related networks (including the sensorimotor, sensory association, and integration areas) showed more nonlinearity, whereas those between the intra-DMN nodes were similarly less nonlinear. These findings may provide a clue for understanding the underlying neuronal principles of the internal and external roles of the DMN.",
   "Neuromodulation of circuits with variable parameters: single neurons and small circuits reveal principles of state-dependent and robust neuromodulation.\nNeuromodulation underlies many behavioral states and has been extensively studied in small circuits. This has allowed the systematic exploration of how neuromodulatory substances and the neurons that release them can influence circuit function. The physiological state of a network and its level of activity can have profound effects on how the modulators act, a phenomenon known as state dependence. We provide insights from experiments and computational work that show how state dependence can arise and the consequences it can have for cellular and circuit function. These observations pose a general unsolved question that is relevant to all nervous systems: How is robust modulation achieved in spite of animal-to-animal variability and degenerate, nonlinear mechanisms for the production of neuronal and network activity?",
   "A hybrid CPU-GPU accelerated framework for fast mapping of high-resolution human brain connectome.\nRecently, a combination of non-invasive neuroimaging techniques and graph theoretical approaches has provided a unique opportunity for understanding the patterns of the structural and functional connectivity of the human brain (referred to as the human brain connectome). Currently, there is a very large amount of brain imaging data that have been collected, and there are very high requirements for the computational capabilities that are used in high-resolution connectome research. In this paper, we propose a hybrid CPU-GPU framework to accelerate the computation of the human brain connectome. We applied this framework to a publicly available resting-state functional MRI dataset from 197 participants. For each subject, we first computed Pearson's Correlation coefficient between any pairs of the time series of gray-matter voxels, and then we constructed unweighted undirected brain networks with 58 k nodes and a sparsity range from 0.02% to 0.17%. Next, graphic properties of the functional brain networks were quantified, analyzed and compared with those of 15 corresponding random networks. With our proposed accelerating framework, the above process for each network cost 80\u223c150 minutes, depending on the network sparsity. Further analyses revealed that high-resolution functional brain networks have efficient small-world properties, significant modular structure, a power law degree distribution and highly connected nodes in the medial frontal and parietal cortical regions. These results are largely compatible with previous human brain network studies. Taken together, our proposed framework can substantially enhance the applicability and efficacy of high-resolution (voxel-based) brain network analysis, and have the potential to accelerate the mapping of the human brain connectome in normal and disease states.",
   "Wiring dendrites in layers and columns.\nThe most striking structure in the nervous system is the complex yet stereotyped morphology of the neuronal dendritic tree. Dendritic morphologies and the connections they make govern information flow and integration in the brain. The fundamental mechanisms that regulate dendritic outgrowth and branching are subjects of extensive study. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the molecular and cellular mechanisms for routing dendrites in layers and columns, prevalent organizational structures in the brain. We highlight how dendritic patterning influences the formation of synaptic circuits.",
   "Preliminary evidence for genetic overlap between body mass index and striatal reward response.\nThe reward-processing network is implicated in the aetiology of obesity. Several lines of evidence suggest obesity-linked genetic risk loci (such as DRD2 and FTO) may influence individual variation in body mass index (BMI) through neuropsychological processes reflected in alterations in activation of the striatum during reward processing. However, no study has tested the broader hypotheses that (a) the relationship between BMI and reward-related brain activation (measured through the blood oxygenation-dependent (BOLD) signal) may be observed in a large population study and (b) the overall genetic architecture of these phenotypes overlap, an assumption critical for the progression of imaging genetic studies in obesity research. Using data from the Human Connectome Project (N\u2009=\u20091055 healthy, young individuals: average BMI\u2009=\u200926.4), we first establish a phenotypic relationship between BMI and ventral striatal (VS) BOLD during the processing of rewarding (monetary) stimuli (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.44, P\u2009=\u20090.013), accounting for potential confounds. BMI and VS BOLD were both significantly influenced by additive genetic factors (H2r\u2009=\u20090.57; 0.12, respectively). Further decomposition of this variance suggested that the relationship was driven by shared genetic (\u03c1 g\u2009=\u20090.47, P\u2009=\u20090.011), but not environmental (\u03c1 E\u2009=\u2009-0.07, P\u2009=\u20090.29) factors. To validate the assumption of genetic pleiotropy between BMI and VS BOLD, we further show that polygenic risk for higher BMI is also associated with increased VS BOLD response to appetitive stimuli (calorically high food images), in an independent sample (N\u2009=\u200981; P FWE-ROI\u2009<\u20090.005). Together, these observations suggest that the genetic factors link risk to obesity to alterations within key nodes of the brain's reward circuity. These observations provide a basis for future work exploring the mechanistic role of genetic loci that confer risk for obesity using the imaging genetics approach.",
   "Autism and sensory processing disorders: shared white matter disruption in sensory pathways but divergent connectivity in social-emotional pathways.\nOver 90% of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) demonstrate atypical sensory behaviors. In fact, hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment is now included in the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. However, there are children with sensory processing differences who do not meet an ASD diagnosis but do show atypical sensory behaviors to the same or greater degree as ASD children. We previously demonstrated that children with Sensory Processing Disorders (SPD) have impaired white matter microstructure, and that this white matter microstructural pathology correlates with atypical sensory behavior. In this study, we use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fiber tractography to evaluate the structural connectivity of specific white matter tracts in boys with ASD (n\u200a=\u200a15) and boys with SPD (n\u200a=\u200a16), relative to typically developing children (n\u200a=\u200a23). We define white matter tracts using probabilistic streamline tractography and assess the strength of tract connectivity using mean fractional anisotropy. Both the SPD and ASD cohorts demonstrate decreased connectivity relative to controls in parieto-occipital tracts involved in sensory perception and multisensory integration. However, the ASD group alone shows impaired connectivity, relative to controls, in temporal tracts thought to subserve social-emotional processing. In addition to these group difference analyses, we take a dimensional approach to assessing the relationship between white matter connectivity and participant function. These correlational analyses reveal significant associations of white matter connectivity with auditory processing, working memory, social skills, and inattention across our three study groups. These findings help elucidate the roles of specific neural circuits in neurodevelopmental disorders, and begin to explore the dimensional relationship between critical cognitive functions and structural connectivity across affected and unaffected children.",
   "Learning Processes and Brain Connectivity in A Cognitive-Motor Task in Neurodegeneration: Evidence from EEG Network Analysis.\nElectroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms are linked to any kind of learning and cognitive performance including motor tasks. The brain is a complex network consisting of spatially distributed networks dedicated to different functions including cognitive domains where dynamic interactions of several brain areas play a pivotal role. Brain connectome could be a useful approach not only to mechanisms underlying brain cognitive functions, but also to those supporting different mental states. This goal was approached via a learning task providing the possibility to predict performance and learning along physiological and pathological brain aging. Eighty-six subjects (22 healthy, 47 amnesic mild cognitive impairment, 17 Alzheimer's disease) were recruited reflecting the whole spectrum of normal and abnormal brain connectivity scenarios. EEG recordings were performed at rest, with closed eyes, both before and after the task (Sensory Motor Learning task consisting of a visual rotation paradigm). Brain network properties were described by Small World index (SW), representing a combination of segregation and integration properties. Correlation analyses showed that alpha 2 SW in pre-task significantly predict learning (r \u200a= \u200a-0.2592, p\u200a<\u200a0.0342): lower alpha 2 SW (higher possibility to increase during task and better the learning of this task), higher the learning as measured by the number of reached targets. These results suggest that, by means of an innovative analysis applied to a low-cost and widely available techniques (SW applied to EEG), the functional connectome approach as well as conventional biomarkers would be effective methods for monitoring learning progress during training both in normal and abnormal conditions.",
   "A Single Session of Robot-Controlled Proprioceptive Training Modulates Functional Connectivity of Sensory Motor Networks and Improves Reaching Accuracy in Chronic Stroke.\nPassive robot-generated arm movements in conjunction with proprioceptive decision making and feedback modulate functional connectivity (FC) in sensory motor networks and improve sensorimotor adaptation in normal individuals. This proof-of-principle study investigates whether these effects can be observed in stroke patients.",
   "Connection strength of the macaque connectome augments topological and functional network attributes.\nMammalian brains constitute complex organized networks of neural projections. On top of their binary topological organization, the strength (or weight) of these neural projections can be highly variable across connections and is thus likely of additional importance to the overall topological and functional organization of the network. Here we investigated the specific distribution pattern of connection strength in the macaque connectome. We performed weighted and binary network analysis on the cortico-cortical connectivity of the macaque provided by the unique tract-tracing dataset of Markov and colleagues (2014) and observed in both analyses a small-world, modular and rich club organization. Moreover, connectivity strength showed a distribution augmenting the architecture identified in the binary network version by enhancing both local network clustering and the central infrastructure for global topological communication and integration. Functional consequences of this topological distribution were further examined using the Kuramoto model for simulating interactions between brain regions and showed that the connectivity strength distribution across connections enhances synchronization within modules and between rich club hubs. Together, our results suggest that neural pathway strength promotes topological properties in the macaque connectome for local processing and global network integration.",
   "Encoding Time in Feedforward Trajectories of a Recurrent Neural Network Model.\nBrain activity evolves through time, creating trajectories of activity that underlie sensorimotor processing, behavior, and learning and memory. Therefore, understanding the temporal nature of neural dynamics is essential to understanding brain function and behavior. In vivo studies have demonstrated that sequential transient activation of neurons can encode time. However, it remains unclear whether these patterns emerge from feedforward network architectures or from recurrent networks and, furthermore, what role network structure plays in timing. We address these issues using a recurrent neural network (RNN) model with distinct populations of excitatory and inhibitory units. Consistent with experimental data, a single RNN could autonomously produce multiple functionally feedforward trajectories, thus potentially encoding multiple timed motor patterns lasting up to several seconds. Importantly, the model accounted for Weber's law, a hallmark of timing behavior. Analysis of network connectivity revealed that efficiency-a measure of network interconnectedness-decreased as the number of stored trajectories increased. Additionally, the balance of excitation (E) and inhibition (I) shifted toward excitation during each unit's activation time, generating the prediction that observed sequential activity relies on dynamic control of the E/I balance. Our results establish for the first time that the same RNN can generate multiple functionally feedforward patterns of activity as a result of dynamic shifts in the E/I balance imposed by the connectome of the RNN. We conclude that recurrent network architectures account for sequential neural activity, as well as for a fundamental signature of timing behavior: Weber's law.",
   "LEICA: Laplacian eigenmaps for group ICA decomposition of fMRI data.\nIndependent component analysis (ICA) is a data-driven method that has been increasingly used for analyzing functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. However, generalizing ICA to multi-subject studies is non-trivial due to the high-dimensionality of the data, the complexity of the underlying neuronal processes, the presence of various noise sources, and inter-subject variability. Current group ICA based approaches typically use several forms of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method to extend ICA for generating group inferences. However, linear dimensionality reduction techniques have serious limitations including the fact that the underlying BOLD signal is a complex function of several nonlinear processes. In this paper, we propose an effective non-linear ICA-based model for extracting group-level spatial maps from multi-subject fMRI datasets. We use a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm based on Laplacian eigenmaps to identify a manifold subspace common to the group, such that this mapping preserves the correlation among voxels' time series as much as possible. These eigenmaps are modeled as linear mixtures of a set of group-level spatial features, which are then extracted using ICA. The resulting algorithm is called LEICA (Laplacian Eigenmaps for group ICA decomposition). We introduce a number of methods to evaluate LEICA using 100-subject resting state and 100-subject working memory task fMRI datasets from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). The test results show that the extracted spatial maps from LEICA are meaningful functional networks similar to those produced by some of the best known methods. Importantly, relative to state-of-the-art methods, our algorithm compares favorably in terms of the functional cohesiveness of the spatial maps generated, as well as in terms of the reproducibility of the results.",
   "Amygdala Resting Connectivity Mediates Association Between Maternal Aggression and Adolescent Major Depression: A 7-Year Longitudinal Study.\nThe parent-adolescent relationship is an important predictor of adolescent mental health, especially depressive disorders. This relationship is constructed in the context of maturing emotion neurobiology and could help shape such neurobiology in ways that are important for current and future mental health. Amygdala resting-state functional networks have been linked to depression, but whether such resting connectivity is associated with parent affective behaviors or acts as a salient mediator between parenting and risk for depressive disorder is unknown.",
   "Default mode network connectivity is associated with long-term clinical outcome in patients with schizophrenia.\nThis study investigated whether resting-state functional connectivity is associated with long-term clinical outcomes of patients with schizophrenia. Resting-state brain images were obtained from 79 outpatients with schizophrenia and 30 healthy controls (HC), using a 3\u202fT-MRI scanner. All patients were 20-50\u202fyears old with >3\u202fyears' duration of illness and appeared clinically stable. We assessed their psychopathology using the 18-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS-18) and divided them into \"good,\" \"moderate,\" and \"poor\" outcome (SZ-GO, SZ-MO, and SZ-PO) groups depending on BPRS-18 total score. We obtained individual functional connectivity maps between a seed region of the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and all other brain regions and compared the functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN) among the HC and 3 schizophrenia outcome groups, with a voxel-wise threshold of P\u202f<\u202f.001 within a cluster-extent threshold of 114 voxels. Additionally, we assessed correlations between functional connectivity and BPRS-18 scores. The SZ-MO and SZ-PO groups showed decreased functional connectivity between PCC and right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), left middle cingulate cortex, and left frontopolar cortex (FPC) compared to the SZ-GO and HC groups. DMN connectivity in the right vmPFC and left FPC negatively correlated with subscale scores of the BPRS-18, except the negative symptoms subscale. In this study, poorer clinical outcomes in patients with schizophrenia were associated with decreased DMN connectivity. In particular, the decreased functional connectivity might be related to the severity of positive and mood symptoms rather than negative symptoms.",
   "Age-related differences in default-mode network connectivity in response to intermittent theta-burst stimulation and its relationships with maintained cognition and brain integrity in healthy aging.\nThe default-mode network (DMN) is affected by advancing age, where particularly long-range connectivity has been consistently reported to be reduced as compared to young individuals. We examined whether there were any differences in the effects of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) in DMN connectivity between younger and older adults, its associations with cognition and brain integrity, as well as with long-term cognitive status. Twenty-four younger and 27 cognitively normal older adults were randomly assigned to receive real or sham iTBS over the left inferior parietal lobule between two resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) acquisitions. Three years later, those older adults who had received real iTBS underwent a cognitive follow-up assessment. Among the younger adults, functional connectivity increased following iTBS in distal DMN areas from the stimulation site. In contrast, older adults exhibited increases in connectivity following iTBS in proximal DMN regions. Moreover, older adults with functional responses to iTBS resembling those of the younger participants exhibited greater brain integrity and higher cognitive performance at baseline and at the 3-year follow-up, along with less cognitive decline. Finally, we observed that 'young-like' functional responses to iTBS were also related to the educational background attained amongst older adults. The present study reveals that functional responses of the DMN to iTBS are modulated by age. Furthermore, combining iTBS and rs-fMRI in older adults may allow characterizing distinctive cognitive profiles in aging and its progression, probably reflecting network plasticity systems that may entail a neurobiological substrate of cognitive reserve.",
   "Cognitive relevance of the community structure of the human brain functional coactivation network.\nThere is growing interest in the complex topology of human brain functional networks, often measured using resting-state functional MRI (fMRI). Here, we used a meta-analysis of the large primary literature that used fMRI or PET to measure task-related activation (>1,600 studies; 1985-2010). We estimated the similarity (Jaccard index) of the activation patterns across experimental tasks between each pair of 638 brain regions. This continuous coactivation matrix was used to build a weighted graph to characterize network topology. The coactivation network was modular, with occipital, central, and default-mode modules predominantly coactivated by specific cognitive domains (perception, action, and emotion, respectively). It also included a rich club of hub nodes, located in parietal and prefrontal cortex and often connected over long distances, which were coactivated by a diverse range of experimental tasks. Investigating the topological role of edges between a deactivated and an activated node, we found that such competitive interactions were most frequent between nodes in different modules or between an activated rich-club node and a deactivated peripheral node. Many aspects of the coactivation network were convergent with a connectivity network derived from resting state fMRI data (n = 27, healthy volunteers); although the connectivity network was more parsimoniously connected and differed in the anatomical locations of some hubs. We conclude that the community structure of human brain networks is relevant to cognitive function. Deactivations may play a role in flexible reconfiguration of the network according to cognitive demand, varying the integration between modules, and between the periphery and a central rich club.",
   "High-resolution data-driven model of the mouse connectome.\nKnowledge of mesoscopic brain connectivity is important for understanding inter- and intraregion information processing. Models of structural connectivity are typically constructed and analyzed with the assumption that regions are homogeneous. We instead use the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas to construct a model of whole-brain connectivity at the scale of 100 \u03bcm voxels. The data consist of 428 anterograde tracing experiments in wild type C57BL/6J mice, mapping fluorescently labeled neuronal projections brain-wide. Inferring spatial connectivity with this dataset is underdetermined, since the approximately 2 \u00d7 105 source voxels outnumber the number of experiments. To address this issue, we assume that connection patterns and strengths vary smoothly across major brain divisions. We model the connectivity at each voxel as a radial basis kernel-weighted average of the projection patterns of nearby injections. The voxel model outperforms a previous regional model in predicting held-out experiments and compared with a human-curated dataset. This voxel-scale model of the mouse connectome permits researchers to extend their previous analyses of structural connectivity to much higher levels of resolution, and it allows for comparison with functional imaging and other datasets.",
   "Functional connectivity in the developing brain: a longitudinal study from 4 to 9months of age.\nWe characterize the development of intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) from 4 to 9months of age with resting state magnetic resonance imaging performed on sleeping infants without sedative medication. Data is analyzed with independent component analysis (ICA). Using both low (30 components) and high (100 components) ICA model order decompositions, we find that the functional network connectivity (FNC) map is largely similar at both 4 and 9months. However at 9months the connectivity strength decreases within local networks and increases between more distant networks. The connectivity within the default-mode network, which contains both local and more distant nodes, also increases in strength with age. The low frequency power spectrum increases with age only in the posterior cingulate cortex and posterior default mode network. These findings are consistent with a general developmental pattern of increasing longer distance functional connectivity over the first year of life and raise questions regarding the developmental importance of the posterior cingulate at this age.",
   "Probabilistic clustering of the human connectome identifies communities and hubs.\nA fundamental assumption in neuroscience is that brain function is constrained by its structural properties. This motivates the idea that the brain can be parcellated into functionally coherent regions based on anatomical connectivity patterns that capture how different areas are interconnected. Several studies have successfully implemented this idea in humans using diffusion weighted MRI, allowing parcellation to be conducted in vivo. Two distinct approaches to connectivity-based parcellation can be identified. The first uses the connection profiles of brain regions as a feature vector, and groups brain regions with similar connection profiles together. Alternatively, one may adopt a network perspective that aims to identify clusters of brain regions that show dense within-cluster and sparse between-cluster connectivity. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic model for connectivity-based parcellation that unifies both approaches. Using the model we are able to obtain a parcellation of the human brain whose clusters may adhere to either interpretation. We find that parts of the connectome consistently cluster as densely connected components, while other parts consistently result in clusters with similar connections. Interestingly, the densely connected components consist predominantly of major cortical areas, while the clusters with similar connection profiles consist of regions that have previously been identified as the 'rich club'; regions known for their integrative role in connectivity. Furthermore, the probabilistic model allows quantification of the uncertainty in cluster assignments. We show that, while most clusters are clearly delineated, some regions are more difficult to assign. These results indicate that care should be taken when interpreting connectivity-based parcellations obtained using alternative deterministic procedures.",
   "Brain functional networks extraction based on fMRI artifact removal: Single subject and group approaches.\nIndependent component analysis (ICA) has been widely applied to identify brain functional networks from multiple-subject fMRI. However, the best approach to handle artifacts is not yet clear. In this work, we study and compare two ICA approaches for artifact removal using simulations and real fMRI data. The first approach, recommended by the human connectome project, performs ICA on individual data to remove artifacts, and then applies group ICA on the cleaned data from all subjects. We refer to this approach as Individual ICA artifact Removal Plus Group ICA (TRPG). A second approach, Group Information Guided ICA (GIG-ICA), performs ICA on group data, and then removes the artifact group independent components (ICs), followed by individual subject ICA using the remaining group ICs as spatial references. Experiments demonstrate that GIG-ICA is more accurate in estimation of sources and time courses, more robust to data quality and quantity, and more reliable for identifying networks than IRPG.",
   "Long-range connections are more severely damaged and relevant for cognition in multiple sclerosis.\nAn efficient network such as the human brain features a combination of global integration of information, driven by long-range connections, and local processing involving short-range connections. Whether these connections are equally damaged in multiple sclerosis is unknown, as is their relevance for cognitive impairment and brain function. Therefore, we cross-sectionally investigated the association between damage to short- and long-range connections with structural network efficiency, the functional connectome and cognition. From the Amsterdam multiple sclerosis cohort, 133 patients (age = 54.2 \u00b1 9.6) with long-standing multiple sclerosis and 48 healthy controls (age = 50.8 \u00b1 7.0) with neuropsychological testing and MRI were included. Structural connectivity was estimated from diffusion tensor images using probabilistic tractography (MRtrix 3.0) between pairs of brain regions. Structural connections were divided into short- (length < quartile 1) and long-range (length > quartile 3) connections, based on the mean distribution of tract lengths in healthy controls. To determine the severity of damage within these connections, (i) fractional anisotropy as a measure for integrity; (ii) total number of fibres; and (iii) percentage of tract affected by lesions were computed for each connecting tract and averaged for short- and long-range connections separately. To investigate the impact of damage in these connections for structural network efficiency, global efficiency was computed. Additionally, resting-state functional connectivity was computed between each pair of brain regions, after artefact removal with FMRIB's ICA-based X-noiseifier. The functional connectivity similarity index was computed by correlating individual functional connectivity matrices with an average healthy control connectivity matrix. Our results showed that the structural network had a reduced efficiency and integrity in multiple sclerosis relative to healthy controls (both P < 0.05). The long-range connections showed the largest reduction in fractional anisotropy (z = -1.03, P < 0.001) and total number of fibres (z = -0.44, P < 0.01), whereas in the short-range connections only fractional anisotropy was affected (z = -0.34, P = 0.03). Long-range connections also demonstrated a higher percentage of tract affected by lesions than short-range connections, independent of tract length (P < 0.001). Damage to long-range connections was more strongly related to structural network efficiency and cognition (fractional anisotropy: r = 0.329 and r = 0.447. number of fibres r = 0.321 and r = 0.278. and percentage of lesions: r = -0.219; r = -0.426, respectively) than damage to short-range connections. Only damage to long-distance connections correlated with a more abnormal functional network (fractional anisotropy: r = 0.226). Our findings indicate that long-range connections are more severely affected by multiple sclerosis-specific damage than short-range connections. Moreover compared to short-range connections, damage to long-range connections better explains network efficiency and cognition.",
   "Integrating neuroinformatics tools in TheVirtualBrain.\nTheVirtualBrain (TVB) is a neuroinformatics Python package representing the convergence of clinical, systems, and theoretical neuroscience in the analysis, visualization and modeling of neural and neuroimaging dynamics. TVB is composed of a flexible simulator for neural dynamics measured across scales from local populations to large-scale dynamics measured by electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and core analytic and visualization functions, all accessible through a web browser user interface. A datatype system modeling neuroscientific data ties together these pieces with persistent data storage, based on a combination of SQL and HDF5. These datatypes combine with adapters allowing TVB to integrate other algorithms or computational systems. TVB provides infrastructure for multiple projects and multiple users, possibly participating under multiple roles. For example, a clinician might import patient data to identify several potential lesion points in the patient's connectome. A modeler, working on the same project, tests these points for viability through whole brain simulation, based on the patient's connectome, and subsequent analysis of dynamical features. TVB also drives research forward: the simulator itself represents the culmination of several simulation frameworks in the modeling literature. The availability of the numerical methods, set of neural mass models and forward solutions allows for the construction of a wide range of brain-scale simulation scenarios. This paper briefly outlines the history and motivation for TVB, describing the framework and simulator, giving usage examples in the web UI and Python scripting.",
   "Greedy low-rank algorithm for spatial connectome regression.\nRecovering brain connectivity from tract tracing data is an important computational problem in the neurosciences. Mesoscopic connectome reconstruction was previously formulated as a structured matrix regression problem (Harris et al. in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2016), but existing techniques do not scale to the whole-brain setting. The corresponding matrix equation is challenging to solve due to large scale, ill-conditioning, and a general form that lacks a convergent splitting. We propose a greedy low-rank algorithm for the connectome reconstruction problem in very high dimensions. The algorithm approximates the solution by a sequence of rank-one updates which exploit the sparse and positive definite problem structure. This algorithm was described previously (Kressner and Sirkovi\u0107 in Numer Lin Alg Appl 22(3):564-583, 2015) but never implemented for this connectome problem, leading to a number of challenges. We have had to design judicious stopping criteria and employ efficient solvers for the three main sub-problems of the algorithm, including an efficient GPU implementation that alleviates the main bottleneck for large datasets. The performance of the method is evaluated on three examples: an artificial \"toy\" dataset and two whole-cortex instances using data from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas. We find that the method is significantly faster than previous methods and that moderate ranks offer a good approximation. This speedup allows for the estimation of increasingly large-scale connectomes across taxa as these data become available from tracing experiments. The data and code are available online.",
   "Changes in functional connectivity and GABA levels with long-term motor learning.\nLearning novel motor skills alters local inhibitory circuits within primary motor cortex (M1) (Floyer-Lea et al., 2006) and changes long-range functional connectivity (Albert et al., 2009). Whether such effects occur with long-term training is less well established. In addition, the relationship between learning-related changes in functional connectivity and local inhibition, and their modulation by practice, has not previously been tested. Here, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to assess functional connectivity and MR spectroscopy to quantify GABA in primary motor cortex (M1) before and after a 6 week regime of juggling practice. Participants practiced for either 30 min (high intensity group) or 15 min (low intensity group) per day. We hypothesized that different training regimes would be reflected in distinct changes in brain connectivity and local inhibition, and that correlations would be found between learning-induced changes in GABA and functional connectivity. Performance improved significantly with practice in both groups and we found no evidence for differences in performance outcomes between the low intensity and high intensity groups. Despite the absence of behavioral differences, we found distinct patterns of brain change in the two groups: the low intensity group showed increases in functional connectivity in the motor network and decreases in GABA, whereas the high intensity group showed decreases in functional connectivity and no significant change in GABA. Changes in functional connectivity correlated with performance outcome. Learning-related changes in functional connectivity correlated with changes in GABA. The results suggest that different training regimes are associated with distinct patterns of brain change, even when performance outcomes are comparable between practice schedules. Our results further indicate that learning-related changes in resting-state network strength in part reflect GABAergic plastic processes.",
   "Self-blame-Selective Hyperconnectivity Between Anterior Temporal and Subgenual Cortices and Prediction of Recurrent Depressive Episodes.\nPatients with remitted major depressive disorder (MDD) were previously found to display abnormal functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity (fMRI) between the right superior anterior temporal lobe (RSATL) and the subgenual cingulate cortex and adjacent septal region (SCSR) when experiencing self-blaming emotions relative to emotions related to blaming others (eg, \"indignation or anger toward others\"). This finding provided the first neural signature of biases toward overgeneralized self-blaming emotions (eg, \"feeling guilty for everything\"), known to have a key role in cognitive vulnerability to MDD. It is unknown whether this neural signature predicts risk of recurrence, a crucial step in establishing its potential as a prognostic biomarker, which is urgently needed for stratification into pathophysiologically more homogeneous subgroups and for novel treatments.",
   "Brain Network Organization Correlates with Autistic Features in Preschoolers with Autism Spectrum Disorders and in Their Fathers: Preliminary Data from a DWI Analysis.\nAutism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that is characterized by an altered brain connectivity organization. Autistic traits below the clinical threshold (i.e., the broad autism phenotype; BAP) are frequent among first-degree relatives of subjects with ASD; however, little is known regarding whether subthreshold behavioral manifestations of ASD mirror also at the neuroanatomical level in parents of ASD probands. To this aim, we applied advanced diffusion network analysis to MRI of 16 dyads consisting of a child with ASD and his father in order to investigate: (i) the correlation between structural network organization and autistic features in preschoolers with ASD (all males; age range 1.5-5.2 years); (ii) the correlation between structural network organization and BAP features in the fathers of individuals with ASD (fath-ASD). Local network measures significantly correlated with autism severity in ASD children and with BAP traits in fath-ASD, while no significant association emerged when considering the global measures of brain connectivity. Notably, an overlap of some brain regions that are crucial for social functioning (cingulum, superior temporal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, frontal pole, and amygdala) in patients with ASD and fath-ASD was detected, suggesting an intergenerational transmission of these neural substrates. Overall, the results of this study may help in elucidating the neurostructural endophenotype of ASD, paving the way for bridging connections between underlying genetic and ASD symptomatology.",
   "Dissociable Disruptions in Thalamic and Hippocampal Resting-State Functional Connectivity in Youth with 22q11.2 Deletions.\nThe 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a recurrent copy number variant with high penetrance for developmental neuropsychiatric disorders. Study of individuals with 22q11DS therefore may offer key insights into neural mechanisms underlying such complex illnesses. Resting-state functional connectivity MRI studies in idiopathic schizophrenia have consistently revealed disruption of thalamic and hippocampal circuitry. Here, we sought to test whether this circuitry is similarly disrupted in the context of this genetic high-risk condition. To this end, resting-state functional connectivity patterns were assessed in a sample of human youth with 22q11DS (n = 42; 59.5% female) and demographically matched healthy controls (n = 39; 53.8% female). Neuroimaging data were acquired via single-band protocols and analyzed in line with methods provided by the Human Connectome Project. We computed functional relationships between individual-specific anatomically defined thalamic and hippocampal seeds and all gray matter voxels in the brain. Whole-brain Type I error protection was achieved through nonparametric permutation-based methods. The 22q11DS patients displayed dissociable disruptions in thalamic and hippocampal functional connectivity relative to control subjects. Thalamocortical coupling was increased in somatomotor regions and reduced across associative networks. The opposite effect was observed for the hippocampus in regards to somatomotor and associative network connectivity. The thalamic and hippocampal dysconnectivity observed in 22q11DS suggests that high genetic risk for psychiatric illness is linked with disruptions in large-scale corticosubcortical networks underlying higher-order cognitive functions. These effects highlight the translational importance of large-effect copy number variants for informing mechanisms underlying neural disruptions observed in idiopathic developmental neuropsychiatric disorders.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Investigation of neuroimaging biomarkers in highly penetrant genetic syndromes represents a more biologically tractable approach to identify neural circuit disruptions underlying developmental neuropsychiatric conditions. The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome confers particularly high risk for psychotic disorders and is thus an important translational model in which to investigate systems-level mechanisms implicated in idiopathic illness. Here, we show resting-state fMRI evidence of large-scale sensory and executive network disruptions in youth with 22q11DS. In particular, this study provides the first evidence that these networks are disrupted in a dissociable fashion with regard to the functional connectivity of the thalamus and hippocampus, suggesting circuit-level dysfunction.",
   "Dynamic Reorganization of Functional Connectivity Reveals Abnormal Temporal Efficiency in Schizophrenia.\nEmerging evidence suggests that schizophrenia is associated with brain dysconnectivity. Nonetheless, the implicit assumption of stationary functional connectivity (FC) adopted in most previous resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies raises an open question of schizophrenia-related aberrations in dynamic properties of resting-state FC. This study introduces an empirical method to examine the dynamic functional dysconnectivity in patients with schizophrenia. Temporal brain networks were estimated from resting-state fMRI of 2 independent datasets (patients/controls = 18/19 and 53/57 for self-recorded dataset and a publicly available replication dataset, respectively) by the correlation of sliding time-windowed time courses among regions of a predefined atlas. Through the newly introduced temporal efficiency approach and temporal random network models, we examined, for the first time, the 3D spatiotemporal architecture of the temporal brain network. We found that although prominent temporal small-world properties were revealed in both groups, temporal brain networks of patients with schizophrenia in both datasets showed a significantly higher temporal global efficiency, which cannot be simply attributable to head motion and sampling error. Specifically, we found localized changes of temporal nodal properties in the left frontal, right medial parietal, and subcortical areas that were associated with clinical features of schizophrenia. Our findings demonstrate that altered dynamic FC may underlie abnormal brain function and clinical symptoms observed in schizophrenia. Moreover, we provide new evidence to extend the dysconnectivity hypothesis in schizophrenia from static to dynamic brain network and highlight the potential of aberrant brain dynamic FC in unraveling the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the disease.",
   "Reliability of graph analysis of resting state fMRI using test-retest dataset from the Human Connectome Project.\nThe exploration of brain networks with resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) combined with graph theoretical approaches has become popular, with the perspective of finding network graph metrics as biomarkers in the context of clinical studies. A preliminary requirement for such findings is to assess the reliability of the graph based connectivity metrics. In previous test-retest (TRT) studies, this reliability has been explored using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) with heterogeneous results. But the issue of sample size has not been addressed. Using the large TRT rs-fMRI dataset from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we computed ICCs and their corresponding p-values (applying permutation and bootstrap techniques) and varied the number of subjects (from 20 to 100), the scan duration (from 400 to 1200 time points), the cost and the graph metrics, using the Anatomic-Automatic Labelling (AAL) parcellation scheme. We quantified the reliability of the graph metrics computed both at global and regional level depending, at optimal cost, on two key parameters, the sample size and the number of time points or scan duration. In the cost range between 20% to 35%, most of the global graph metrics are reliable with 40 subjects or more with long scan duration (14min 24s). In large samples (for instance, 100 subjects), most global and regional graph metrics are reliable for a minimum scan duration of 7min 14s. Finally, for 40 subjects and long scan duration (14min 24s), the reliable regions are located in the main areas of the default mode network (DMN), the motor and the visual networks.",
   "The Stochastic Entanglement and Phantom Motor Execution Hypotheses: A Theoretical Framework for the Origin and Treatment of Phantom Limb Pain.\nPhantom limb pain (PLP) is a debilitating condition common after amputation that can considerably hinder patients' quality of life. Several treatments have reported promising results in alleviating PLP. However, clinical evaluations are usually performed in small cohorts and rigorous clinical trials are scarce. In addition, the underlying mechanisms by which novel interventions alleviate PLP are often unclear, potentially because the condition itself is poorly understood. This article presents a theoretical framework of PLP that can be used as groundwork for hypotheses of novel treatments. Current hypotheses on the origins of PLP are discussed in relation to available clinical findings. Stochastic entanglement of the pain neurosignature, or connectome, with impaired sensorimotor circuitry is proposed as an alternative hypothesis for the genesis of PLP, and the implications and predictions this hypothesis entails are examined. In addition, I present a hypothesis for the working mechanism of Phantom Motor Execution (PME) as a treatment of PLP, along with its relation to the aforementioned stochastic entanglement hypothesis, which deals with PLP's incipience. PME aims to reactivate the original central and peripheral circuitry involved in motor control of the missing limb, along with increasing dexterity of stump muscles. The PME hypothesis entails that training of phantom movements induces gradual neural changes similar to those of perfecting a motor skill, and these purposefully induced neural changes disentangle pain processing circuitry by competitive plasticity. This is a testable hypothesis that can be examined by brain imaging and behavioral studies on subjects undergoing PME treatment. The proposed stochastic entanglement hypothesis of PLP can be generalized to neuropathic pain due to sensorimotor impairment, and can be used to design suitable therapeutic treatments.",
   "Phase to amplitude coupling as a potential biomarker for creative ideation: an EEG study.\nThe most consistent finding of creative ideation in the neuroscientific study of creativity is the increment of EEG \u03b1 power. However, the majority of existing studies focused only on ERP experimental paradigms while only a few analyzed time-related changes of EEG \u03b1 power patterns during the time unlocked creation of ideas. Here, we designed an experimental paradigm where the participants were asked to generate alternative uses of everyday objects (AU task). For the control task, we adopted an Object Characteristics (OC) task, for which participants were asked to list typical characteristics or properties of an object. We estimated relative power spectrum, global efficiency from brain networks constructed with the imaginary part of coherence and phase-to-amplitude coupling (PAC) as potential biomarkers of creativity. Both relative power spectrum and nodal global efficiency failed to reach significant level by comparing AU with OC. In contrast, statistically significant differences between AU and OC were detected with PAC estimated within sensors in frequency pairs \u03b8-\u03b3 and \u03b12-\u03b3. Our results can be the ground for both detecting and designing a connectomic biomarker of creativity.",
   "Differences in motor network dynamics during recovery between supra- and infra-tentorial ischemic strokes.\nMost previous stroke studies have been performed in heterogeneous patient populations. Moreover, the brain network might demonstrate different recovery dynamics according to lesion location. In this study, we investigated variation in motor network alterations according to lesion location. Forty patients with subcortical ischemic stroke were enrolled. Patients were divided into two groups: 21 patients with supratentorial stroke (STS) and 19 patients with infratentorial stroke (ITS). All patients underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and behavioral assessment at 2 weeks and 3 months poststroke. Twenty-four healthy subjects participated as a control group. To compare altered connectivity between groups, measures used in previous studies to evaluate interhemispheric balance and global network reorganization were investigated and the relationship between network measures and motor functions were examined. Cortico-cerebellar connectivity was also extracted to investigate its relationship with interhemispheric connectivity. In the STS group, measures related to interhemispheric balance were disrupted compared to the control group 2 weeks poststroke, while this was not found in the ITS group. During recovery, measures related to global network reorganization in the STS group and measures related to interhemispheric balance in the ITS group demonstrated significant changes, respectively. Moreover, motor functions were correlated with altered network measures in both groups. There was an interactive relationship between cortico-cerebellar and interhemispheric cortical connectivity only in the ITS group. Different changes in the motor network were observed depending on the location of stroke lesions. These results might originate from differences in the interactions between cortico-cerebellar and interhemispheric connectivity.",
   "Big Data Approaches for the Analysis of Large-Scale fMRI Data Using Apache Spark and GPU Processing: A Demonstration on Resting-State fMRI Data from the Human Connectome Project.\nTechnologies for scalable analysis of very large datasets have emerged in the domain of internet computing, but are still rarely used in neuroimaging despite the existence of data and research questions in need of efficient computation tools especially in fMRI. In this work, we present software tools for the application of Apache Spark and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to neuroimaging datasets, in particular providing distributed file input for 4D NIfTI fMRI datasets in Scala for use in an Apache Spark environment. Examples for using this Big Data platform in graph analysis of fMRI datasets are shown to illustrate how processing pipelines employing it can be developed. With more tools for the convenient integration of neuroimaging file formats and typical processing steps, big data technologies could find wider endorsement in the community, leading to a range of potentially useful applications especially in view of the current collaborative creation of a wealth of large data repositories including thousands of individual fMRI datasets.",
   "MICA-A toolbox for masked independent component analysis of fMRI data.\nIndependent component analysis (ICA) is a widely used technique for investigating functional connectivity (fc) in functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Masked independent component analysis (mICA), that is, ICA restricted to a defined region of interest, has been shown to detect local fc networks in particular brain regions, including the cerebellum, brainstem, posterior cingulate cortex, operculo-insular cortex, hippocampus, and spinal cord. Here, we present the mICA toolbox, an open-source GUI toolbox based on FSL command line tools that performs mICA and related analyses in an integrated way. Functions include automated mask generation from atlases, essential preprocessing, mICA-based parcellation, back-reconstruction of whole-brain fc networks from local ones, and reproducibility analysis. Automated slice-wise calculation and cropping are additional functions that reduce computational time and memory requirements for large analyses. To validate our toolbox, we tested these different functions on the cerebellum, hippocampus, and brainstem, using resting-state and task-based data from the Human Connectome Project. In the cerebellum, mICA detected six local networks together with their whole-brain counterparts, closely replicating previous results. MICA-based parcellation of the hippocampus showed a longitudinally discrete configuration with greater heterogeneity in the anterior hippocampus, consistent with animal and human literature. Finally, brainstem mICA detected motor and sensory nuclei involved in the motor task of tongue movement, thereby replicating and extending earlier results. Hum Brain Mapp 37:3544-3556, 2016.",
   "Spatiotemporal Feedback and Network Structure Drive and Encode Caenorhabditis elegans Locomotion.\nUsing a computational model of the Caenorhabditis elegans connectome dynamics, we show that proprioceptive feedback is necessary for sustained dynamic responses to external input. This is consistent with the lack of biophysical evidence for a central pattern generator, and recent experimental evidence that proprioception drives locomotion. The low-dimensional functional response of the Caenorhabditis elegans network of neurons to proprioception-like feedback is optimized by input of specific spatial wavelengths which correspond to the spatial scale of real body shape dynamics. Furthermore, we find that the motor subcircuit of the network is responsible for regulating this response, in agreement with experimental expectations. To explore how the connectomic dynamics produces the observed two-mode, oscillatory limit cycle behavior from a static fixed point, we probe the fixed point's low-dimensional structure using Dynamic Mode Decomposition. This reveals that the nonlinear network dynamics encode six clusters of dynamic modes, with timescales spanning three orders of magnitude. Two of these six dynamic mode clusters correspond to previously-discovered behavioral modes related to locomotion. These dynamic modes and their timescales are encoded by the network's degree distribution and specific connectivity. This suggests that behavioral dynamics are partially encoded within the connectome itself, the connectivity of which facilitates proprioceptive control.",
   "Dysregulated Maturation of the Functional Connectome in Antipsychotic-Na\u00efve, First-Episode Patients With Adolescent-Onset Schizophrenia.\nSchizophrenia has been conceptualized as a brain network disorder rooted in dysregulated neurodevelopmental processes. Recent neuroimaging studies revealed disrupted brain connectomic organization in adult schizophrenia patients. However, altered developmental trajectories of the functional connectome during the adolescent maturational stage have not been examined.",
   "DynamicBC: a MATLAB toolbox for dynamic brain connectome analysis.\nThe brain connectome collects the complex network architectures, looking at both static and dynamic functional connectivity. The former normally requires stationary signals and connections. However, the human brain activity and connections are most likely time dependent and dynamic, and related to ongoing rhythmic activity. We developed an open-source MATLAB toolbox DynamicBC with user-friendly graphical user interfaces, implementing both dynamic functional and effective connectivity for tracking brain dynamics from functional MRI. We provided two strategies for dynamic analysis: (1) the commonly utilized sliding-window analysis and (2) the flexible least squares based time-varying parameter regression strategy. The toolbox also implements multiple functional measures including seed-to-voxel analysis, region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI analysis, and voxel-to-voxel analysis. We describe the principles of the implemented algorithms, and then present representative results from simulations and empirical data applications. We believe that this toolbox will help neuroscientists and neurologists to easily map dynamic brain connectomics.",
   "Dynamic reconfiguration of cortical functional connectivity across brain states.\nThroughout each day, the brain displays transient changes in state, as evidenced by shifts in behavior and vigilance. While the electrophysiological correlates of brain states have been studied for some time, it remains unclear how large-scale cortico-cortical functional connectivity systematically reconfigures across states. Here, we investigate state-dependent shifts in cortical functional connectivity by recording local field potentials (LFPs) during spontaneous behavioral transitions in the ferret using chronically implanted micro-electrocorticographic (\u00b5ECoG) arrays positioned over occipital, parietal, and temporal cortical regions. To objectively classify brain state, we describe a data-driven approach that projects time-varying LFP spectral properties into brain state space. Distinct brain states displayed markedly different patterns of cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling and inter-electrode phase synchronization across several LFP frequency bands. The largest across-state differences in functional connectivity were observed between periods of presumed slow-wave and rapid-eye-movement-sleep/active-state, which were characterized by the contrasting phenomena of cortical network fragmentation and global synchronization, respectively. Collectively, our data provide strong evidence that large-scale functional interactions in the brain dynamically reconfigure across behavioral states.",
   "Global disruption of degree rank order: a hallmark of chronic pain.\nChronic pain remains poorly understood; yet it is associated with the reorganization of the nervous system. Here, we demonstrate that a unitary global measure of functional connectivity, defined as the extent of degree rank order disruption, kD, identifies the chronic pain state. In contrast, local degree disruption differentiates between chronic pain conditions. We used resting-state functional MRI data to analyze the brain connectome at varying scales and densities. In three chronic pain conditions, we observe disrupted kD, in proportion to individuals' pain intensity, and associated with community membership disruption. Additionally, we observe regional degree changes, some of which were unique to each type of chronic pain. Subjects with recent onset of back pain exhibited emergence of kD only when the pain became chronic. Similarly, in neuropathic rats kD emerged weeks after injury, in proportion to pain-like behavior. Thus, we found comprehensive cross-species evidence for chronic pain being a state of global randomization of functional connectivity.",
   "The Human Connectome Project and beyond: initial applications of 300 mT/m gradients.\nThe engineering of a 3 T human MRI scanner equipped with 300 mT/m gradients - the strongest gradients ever built for an in vivo human MRI scanner - was a major component of the NIH Blueprint Human Connectome Project (HCP). This effort was motivated by the HCP's goal of mapping, as completely as possible, the macroscopic structural connections of the in vivo healthy, adult human brain using diffusion tractography. Yet, the 300 mT/m gradient system is well suited to many additional types of diffusion measurements. Here, we present three initial applications of the 300 mT/m gradients that fall outside the immediate scope of the HCP. These include: 1) diffusion tractography to study the anatomy of consciousness and the mechanisms of brain recovery following traumatic coma; 2) q-space measurements of axon diameter distributions in the in vivo human brain and 3) postmortem diffusion tractography as an adjunct to standard histopathological analysis. We show that the improved sensitivity and diffusion-resolution provided by the gradients are rapidly enabling human applications of techniques that were previously possible only for in vitro and animal models on small-bore scanners, thereby creating novel opportunities to map the microstructure of the human brain in health and disease.",
   "Disrupted brain metabolic connectivity in a 6-OHDA-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease examined using persistent homology-based analysis.\nMovement impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD) are caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and the consequent disruption of connectivity in the cortico-striatal-thalamic loop. This study evaluated brain metabolic connectivity in a 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced mouse model of PD using (18)F-fluorodeoxy glucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET). Fourteen PD-model mice and ten control mice were used for the analysis. Voxel-wise t-tests on FDG PET results yielded no significant regional metabolic differences between the PD and control groups. However, the PD group showed lower correlations between the right caudoputamen and the left caudoputamen and right visual cortex. Further network analyses based on the threshold-free persistent homology framework revealed that brain networks were globally disrupted in the PD group, especially between the right auditory cortex and bilateral cortical structures and the left caudoputamen. In conclusion, regional glucose metabolism of PD was preserved, but the metabolic connectivity of the cortico-striatal-thalamic loop was globally impaired in PD.",
   "Aberrant functional brain connectome in people with antisocial personality disorder.\nAntisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is characterised by a disregard for social obligations and callous unconcern for the feelings of others. Studies have demonstrated that ASPD is associated with abnormalities in brain regions and aberrant functional connectivity. In this paper, topological organisation was examined in resting-state fMRI data obtained from 32 ASPD patients and 32 non-ASPD controls. The frequency-dependent functional networks were constructed using wavelet-based correlations over 90 brain regions. The topology of the functional networks of ASPD subjects was analysed via graph theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the abnormal functional connectivity was determined with a network-based statistic (NBS) approach. Our results revealed that, compared with the controls, the ASPD patients exhibited altered topological configuration of the functional connectome in the frequency interval of 0.016-0.031\u2009Hz, as indicated by the increased clustering coefficient and decreased betweenness centrality in the medial superior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, Rolandic operculum, superior parietal gyrus, angular gyrus, and middle temporal pole. In addition, the ASPD patients showed increased functional connectivity mainly located in the default-mode network. The present study reveals an aberrant topological organisation of the functional brain network in individuals with ASPD. Our findings provide novel insight into the neuropathological mechanisms of ASPD.",
   "Presurgical connectome and postsurgical seizure control in temporal lobe epilepsy.\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate whether patients with surgically refractory medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) exhibit a distinct pattern of structural network organization involving the temporal lobes and extratemporal regions.",
   "Connectome Analysis of Brain Functional Network Alterations in Depressive Patients with Suicidal Attempt.\nOur study aimed to clarify the neuroimaging correlates of suicide attempt by comparing differences in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) among depressed suicide attempters, depressed patients without suicide attempt history, and healthy controls through comprehensive and novel fMRI analyses and methods in the same study population. The association between depression severity and aspects of the brain imaging was also discussed. Our study recruited 109 participants who were assigned to three groups: 33 depressed patients with suicide attempt (SA), 32 depressed patients without suicide attempt (NS), and 44 healthy controls (HC). All participants were scanned using a 3 T MRI imaging system to obtain resting-state functional images. In seed-based correlation analysis, we found altered functional connectivity in some brain regions of the SA compared with the NS or HC, especially in the hippocampus and thalamus. In the voxel-based analysis, our results showed differential activation and regional homogeneity of the temporal lobe and several brain regions in the SA compared with the NS and HC. We also found that some brain areas correlated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), anxiety, and depression scores, especially in the frontal and temporal lobes. Graph theoretical analysis (GTA) and network-based statistical (NBS) analyses revealed different topological organization as well as slightly better global integration and worse local segregation of the brain network (i.e., more like a random network) in depressed participants compared with healthy participants. We concluded that the brain function of major depressive disorders with and without suicide attempts changed compared with healthy participants.",
   "Human brain atlasing: past, present and future.\nWe have recently witnessed an explosion of large-scale initiatives and projects addressing mapping, modeling, simulation and atlasing of the human brain, including the BRAIN Initiative, the Human Brain Project, the Human Connectome Project (HCP), the Big Brain, the Blue Brain Project, the Allen Brain Atlas, the Brainnetome, among others. Besides these large and international initiatives, there are numerous mid-size and small brain atlas-related projects. My contribution to these global efforts has been to create adult human brain atlases in health and disease, and to develop atlas-based applications. For over two decades with my R&D lab I developed 35 brain atlases, licensed to 67 companies and made available in about 100 countries. This paper has two objectives. First, it provides an overview of the state of the art in brain atlasing. Second, as it is already 20 years from the release of our first brain atlas, I summarise my past and present efforts, share my experience in atlas creation, validation and commercialisation, compare with the state of the art, and propose future directions.",
   "Disturbed functional connectivity within the left prefrontal cortex and sensorimotor areas predicts impaired cognitive speed in patients with first-episode schizophrenia.\nThis study aimed at identifying abnormal cortico-cortical functional connectivity patterns that could predict cognitive slowing in patients with schizophrenia. A group of thirty-two patients with the first-episode schizophrenia and comparable healthy controls underwent resting-state qEEG and cognitive assessment. Phase Lag Index (PLI) was applied as a connectivity index and the synchronizations were analyzed in six frequencies. Pairs of electrodes were grouped to separately cover frontal, temporal, central, parietal and occipital regions. PLI was calculated for intra-regional connectivity and between-regions connectivity. Computer version processing speed tests were applied to control for possible fluctuations in cognitive efficiency during the performance of the tasks. In the group of patients, in comparison to healthy controls, significantly higher PLI values were recorded in theta frequency, especially in the posterior areas and decreased PLI in low-alpha frequency within the frontal regions. Mean PLI in gamma frequency was also lower in the patients group. Regression analysis showed that lower intra-regional PLI for left frontal cortex and higher PLI within somatosensory cortex in theta band, together with the duration of untreated psychosis, proved to be significant predictors of impaired processing speed in first-episode patients. Our investigation confirmed that disrupted cortico-cortical synchronization contributes to cognitive slowing in schizophrenia.",
   "Connectome-based individualized prediction of loneliness.\nLoneliness is an increasingly prevalent condition linking with enhanced morbidity and premature mortality. Despite recent proposal on medicalization of loneliness, so far no effort has been made to establish a model capable of predicting loneliness at the individual level. Here, we applied a machine-learning approach to decode loneliness from whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). The relationship between whole-brain RSFC and loneliness was examined in a linear predictive model. The results revealed that individual loneliness could be predicted by within- and between-network connectivity of prefrontal, limbic and temporal systems, which are involved in cognitive control, emotional processing and social perceptions and communications, respectively. Key nodes that contributed to the prediction model comprised regions previously implicated in loneliness, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, lateral orbital frontal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, caudate, amygdala and temporal regions. Our findings also demonstrated that both loneliness and associated neural substrates are modulated by levels of neuroticism and extraversion. The current data-driven approach provides the first evidence on the predictive brain features of loneliness based on organizations of intrinsic brain networks. Our work represents initial efforts in the direction of making individualized prediction of loneliness that could be useful for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.",
   "Reduced structural connectivity within a prefrontal-motor-subcortical network in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\nTo investigate white matter structural connectivity changes associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using network analysis and compare the results with those obtained using standard voxel-based methods, specifically Tract-based Spatial Statistics (TBSS).",
   "Dynamic Network Activation of Hypothalamic MCH Neurons in REM Sleep and Exploratory Behavior.\nMost brain neurons are active in waking, but hypothalamic neurons that synthesize the neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) are claimed to be active only during sleep, particularly rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Here we use deep-brain imaging to identify changes in fluorescence of the genetically encoded calcium (Ca2+) indicator GCaMP6 in individual hypothalamic neurons that contain MCH. An in vitro electrophysiology study determined a strong relationship between depolarization and Ca2+ fluorescence in MCH neurons. In 10 freely behaving MCH-cre mice (male and female), the highest fluorescence occurred in all recorded neurons (n = 106) in REM sleep relative to quiet waking or non-REM sleep. Unexpectedly, 70% of the MCH neurons had strong fluorescence activity when the mice explored novel objects. Spatial and temporal mapping of the change in fluorescence between pairs of MCH neurons revealed dynamic activation of MCH neurons during REM sleep and activation of a subset of the same neurons during exploratory behavior. Functional network activity maps will facilitate comparisons of not only single-neuron activity, but also network responses in different conditions and disease.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Functional activity maps identify brain circuits responding to specific behaviors, including rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep), a sleep phase when the brain is as active as in waking. To provide the first activity map of individual neurons during REM sleep, we use deep-brain calcium imaging in unrestrained mice to map the activity of hypothalamic melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons. MCH neurons were found to be synchronously active during REM sleep, and also during the exploration of novel objects. Spatial mapping revealed dynamic network activation during REM sleep and activation of a subset of the neurons during exploratory behavior. Functional activity maps at the cellular level in specific behaviors, including sleep, are needed to establish a brain connectome.",
   "Convergence and Divergence of Brain Network Dysfunction in Deficit and Non-deficit Schizophrenia.\nDeficit schizophrenia (DS), characterized by primary and enduring negative symptoms, has been considered as a pathophysiologically distinct schizophrenic subgroup. Neuroimaging characteristics of DS, especially functional brain network architecture, remain largely unknown. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and graph theory approaches were employed to investigate the topological organization of whole-brain functional networks of 114 male participants including 33 DS, 41 non-deficit schizophrenia (NDS) and 40 healthy controls (HCs). At the whole-brain level, both the NDS and DS group exhibited lower local efficiency (Eloc) than the HC group, implying the reduction of local specialization of brain information processing (reduced functional segregation). The DS, but not NDS group, exhibited enhanced parallel information transfer (enhanced functional integration) as determined by smaller characteristic path length (Lp) and higher global efficiency (Eglob). The Lp and Eglob presented significant correlations with Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total score in the DS group. At the nodal level, both the NDS and DS groups showed higher functional connectivity in the inferior frontal gyrus and hippocampus, and lower connectivity in the visual areas and striatum than the controls. The DS group exhibited higher nodal connectivity in the right inferior temporal gyrus than the NDS and HC group. The diminished expression of Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) subfactors negatively correlated with nodal connectivity of right putamen, while asociality/amotivation positively correlated with right hippocampus across whole patients. We highlighted the convergence and divergence of brain functional network dysfunctions in patients with DS and NDS, which provides crucial insights into pathophysiological mechanisms of the 2 schizophrenic subtypes.",
   "Structural connectome topology relates to regional BOLD signal dynamics in the mouse brain.\nBrain dynamics are thought to unfold on a network determined by the pattern of axonal connections linking pairs of neuronal elements; the so-called connectome. Prior work has indicated that structural brain connectivity constrains pairwise correlations of brain dynamics (\"functional connectivity\"), but it is not known whether inter-regional axonal connectivity is related to the intrinsic dynamics of individual brain areas. Here we investigate this relationship using a weighted, directed mesoscale mouse connectome from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas and resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) time-series data measured in 184 brain regions in eighteen anesthetized mice. For each brain region, we measured degree, betweenness, and clustering coefficient from weighted and unweighted, and directed and undirected versions of the connectome. We then characterized the univariate rs-fMRI dynamics in each brain region by computing 6930 time-series properties using the time-series analysis toolbox, hctsa. After correcting for regional volume variations, strong and robust correlations between structural connectivity properties and rs-fMRI dynamics were found only when edge weights were accounted for, and were associated with variations in the autocorrelation properties of the rs-fMRI signal. The strongest relationships were found for weighted in-degree, which was positively correlated to the autocorrelation of fMRI time series at time lag \u03c4\u2009=\u200934 s (partial Spearman correlation \u03c1=0.58), as well as a range of related measures such as relative high frequency power (f\u2009>\u20090.4\u2009Hz: \u03c1=-0.43). Our results indicate that the topology of inter-regional axonal connections of the mouse brain is closely related to intrinsic, spontaneous dynamics such that regions with a greater aggregate strength of incoming projections display longer timescales of activity fluctuations.",
   "Altered spatial and temporal concordance among intrinsic brain activity measures in schizophrenia.\nVarious data-driven voxel-wise measures derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been developed to characterize spontaneous brain activity. These measures have been widely applied to explore brain functional changes in schizophrenia and have enjoyed significant success in unraveling the neural mechanisms of this disorder. However, their spatial and temporal coupling alterations in schizophrenia remain largely unknown. To address this issue, 88 schizophrenia patients and 116 gender- and age-matched healthy controls underwent rs-fMRI examinations. Kendall's W was used to calculate volume-wise (across voxels) and voxel-wise (across time windows) concordance among multiple commonly used measures, including fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, regional homogeneity, voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity, degree centrality and global signal connectivity. Inter-group differences in the concordance were investigated. Results revealed that whole gray matter volume-wise concordance was reduced in schizophrenia patients relative to healthy controls. Although two groups showed similar spatial distributions of the voxel-wise concordance, quantitative comparison analysis revealed that schizophrenia patients exhibited decreased voxel-wise concordance in gray matter areas spanning the bilateral frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal and insular cortices. In addition, these concordance changes were negatively correlated with onset age in schizophrenia patients. Our findings suggest that the concordance approaches may provide new insights into the neural mechanisms of schizophrenia and have the potential to be extended to neuropsychiatric disorders.",
   "BrainNetCNN: Convolutional neural networks for brain networks; towards predicting neurodevelopment.\nWe propose BrainNetCNN, a convolutional neural network (CNN) framework to predict clinical neurodevelopmental outcomes from brain networks. In contrast to the spatially local convolutions done in traditional image-based CNNs, our BrainNetCNN is composed of novel edge-to-edge, edge-to-node and node-to-graph convolutional filters that leverage the topological locality of structural brain networks. We apply the BrainNetCNN framework to predict cognitive and motor developmental outcome scores from structural brain networks of infants born preterm. Diffusion tensor images (DTI) of preterm infants, acquired between 27 and 46 weeks gestational age, were used to construct a dataset of structural brain connectivity networks. We first demonstrate the predictive capabilities of BrainNetCNN on synthetic phantom networks with simulated injury patterns and added noise. BrainNetCNN outperforms a fully connected neural-network with the same number of model parameters on both phantoms with focal and diffuse injury patterns. We then apply our method to the task of joint prediction of Bayley-III cognitive and motor scores, assessed at 18 months of age, adjusted for prematurity. We show that our BrainNetCNN framework outperforms a variety of other methods on the same data. Furthermore, BrainNetCNN is able to identify an infant's postmenstrual age to within about 2 weeks. Finally, we explore the high-level features learned by BrainNetCNN by visualizing the importance of each connection in the brain with respect to predicting the outcome scores. These findings are then discussed in the context of the anatomy and function of the developing preterm infant brain.",
   "New insights into cortico-basal-cerebellar connectome: clinical and physiological considerations.\nThe current model of the basal ganglia system based on the 'direct', 'indirect' and 'hyperdirect' pathways provides striking predictions about basal ganglia function that have been used to develop deep brain stimulation approaches for Parkinson's disease and dystonia. The aim of this review is to challenge this scheme in light of new tract tracing information that has recently become available from the human brain using MRI-based tractography, thus providing a novel perspective on the basal ganglia system. We also explore the implications of additional direct pathways running from cortex to basal ganglia and between basal ganglia and cerebellum in the pathophysiology of movement disorders.",
   "Increased Functional Connectivity Within and Between Cognitive-Control Networks from Early Infancy to Nine Years During Story Listening.\nThe cingulo-opercular (CO) and frontoparietal (FP) networks are part of the cognitive-control system of the brain. Evidence suggests that over the course of development, brain regions supporting cognitive-control functions become more integrated within their networks (i.e., have increased within-network connectivity), more separated from other networks, and, due to increased maturation along development, are more functionally connected between the networks. The focus of this study was to characterize the developmental trajectory of the CO and FP networks from early infancy (17 months) to 9 years of age in typically developing children while listening to stories, using functional connectivity analyses. Seventy-four children underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging session while listening to stories inside the scanner. Within- and between-network functional connectivity and graph theory measures were compared during development. Developmental increase in functional connectivity within the CO network and between the CO and FP networks, as well as global efficiency of the CO network from 17 months to 9 years of age, was observed. These findings highlight the involvement of the CO and FP networks in story listening from early infancy, which increases along development. Future studies examining failures in language acquisition to further explore the role of these networks in story listening are warranted.",
   "Simulation laboratories for training in obstetrics and gynecology.\nSimulations have been used by the military, airline industry, and our colleagues in other medical specialties to educate, evaluate, and prepare for rare but life-threatening scenarios. Work hour limits for residents in obstetrics and gynecology and decreased patient availability for teaching of students and residents require us to think creatively and practically on how to optimize their education. Medical simulations may address scenarios in clinical practice that are considered important to know or understand. Simulations can take many forms, including computer programs, models or mannequins, virtual reality data immersion caves, and a combination of formats. The purpose of this commentary is to call attention to a potential role for medical simulation in obstetrics and gynecology. We briefly describe an example of how simulation may be incorporated into obstetric and gynecologic residency training. It is our contention that educators in obstetrics and gynecology should be aware of the potential for simulation in education. We hope this commentary will stimulate interest in the field, lead to validation studies, and improve training in and the practice of obstetrics and gynecology.",
   "A geometric method for computing ocular kinematics and classifying gaze events using monocular remote eye tracking in a robotic environment.\nRobotic and virtual-reality systems offer tremendous potential for improving assessment and rehabilitation of neurological disorders affecting the upper extremity. A key feature of these systems is that visual stimuli are often presented within the same workspace as the hands (i.e., peripersonal space). Integrating video-based remote eye tracking with robotic and virtual-reality systems can provide an additional tool for investigating how cognitive processes influence visuomotor learning and rehabilitation of the upper extremity. However, remote eye tracking systems typically compute ocular kinematics by assuming eye movements are made in a plane with constant depth (e.g. frontal plane). When visual stimuli are presented at variable depths (e.g. transverse plane), eye movements have a vergence component that may influence reliable detection of gaze events (fixations, smooth pursuits and saccades). To our knowledge, there are no available methods to classify gaze events in the transverse plane for monocular remote eye tracking systems. Here we present a geometrical method to compute ocular kinematics from a monocular remote eye tracking system when visual stimuli are presented in the transverse plane. We then use the obtained kinematics to compute velocity-based thresholds that allow us to accurately identify onsets and offsets of fixations, saccades and smooth pursuits. Finally, we validate our algorithm by comparing the gaze events computed by the algorithm with those obtained from the eye-tracking software and manual digitization.",

   "Monitoring of spine curvatures and posture during pregnancy using surface topography - case study and suggestion of method.\nLow back and pelvic pain is one of the most frequently reported disorders in pregnancy, however etiology and pathology of this problem have not been fully determined. The relationship between back pain experienced during pregnancy and posture remains unclear. It is challenging to measure reliably postural and spinal changes at the time of pregnancy, since most imaging studies cannot be used due to the radiation burden. 3D shape measurement, or surface topography (ST), systems designed for posture evaluation could potentially fill this void. A pilot study was conducted to test the potential of monitoring the change of spine curvatures and posture during pregnancy using surface topography. A single case was studied to test the methodology and preliminarily assess the usefulness of the procedure before performing a randomized trial. The apparatus used in this study was metrologically tested and utilized earlier in scoliosis screening.",

   "Three-dimensional segmentation of tumors from CT image data using an adaptive fuzzy system.\nA new segmentation method using a fuzzy rule based system to segment tumors in a three-dimensional CT data was developed. To initialize the segmentation process, the user selects a region of interest (ROI) within the tumor in the first image of the CT study set. Using the ROI's spatial and intensity properties, fuzzy inputs are generated for use in the fuzzy rules inference system. With a set of predefined fuzzy rules, the system generates a defuzzified output for every pixel in terms of similarity to the object. Pixels with the highest similarity values are selected as tumor. This process is automatically repeated for every subsequent slice in the CT set without further user input, as the segmented region from the previous slice is used as the ROI for the current slice. This creates a propagation of information from the previous slices, used to segment the current slice. The membership functions used during the fuzzification and defuzzification processes are adaptive to the changes in the size and pixel intensities of the current ROI. The method is highly customizable to suit different needs of a user, requiring information from only a single two-dimensional image. Test cases success in segmenting the tumor from seven of the 10 CT datasets with <10% false positive errors and five test cases with <10% false negative errors. The consistency of the segmentation results statistics also showed a high repeatability factor, with low values of inter- and intra-user variability for both methods.",
   "[Exergaming for patients with metabolic syndrome?!]\nDue to the tremendous technical progress that has been made in recent years and the increased interest in using new technologies in sports and exercise, the effects of \"exergaming\" (exercise with video games and the use of an interactive computer-generated virtual reality) on human health have been investigated in numerous research projects. This systematic mini review analyzes the effects of regular exergaming in patients with components of metabolic syndrome. The review indicates that improvements in different variables, e.g., body mass index, body fat, glycemic control and blood lipid/lipoprotein levels, as well as blood pressure, can be achieved through regular exergaming. Future studies should examine whether exergaming can motivate patients with metabolic syndrome to engage in physical activity in the long term. Support from and (initial) supervision by health professionals (sports coaches, physiotherapists) are recommended to increase positive outcomes.",

   "Mere observation of body discontinuity affects perceived ownership and vicarious agency over a virtual hand.\nThe mental representation of one's body typically implies the continuity of its parts. Here, we used immersive virtual reality to explore whether mere observation of visual discontinuity between the hand and limb of an avatar could influence a person's sense of ownership of the virtual body (feeling of ownership, FO) and being the agent of its actions (vicarious agency, VA). In experiment 1, we tested whether placing different amounts of visual discontinuity between a virtual hand and limb differently modulate the perceived FO and VA. Participants passively observed from a first-person perspective four different versions of a virtual limb: (1) a full limb; a hand detached from the proximal part of the limb because of deletion of (2) the wrist; (3) the wrist and forearm; (4) and the wrist, forearm and elbow. After observing the static or moving virtual limb, participants reported their feeling of ownership (FO) and vicarious agency (VA) over the hand. We found that even a small visual discontinuity between the virtual hand and arm significantly decreased participants' FO over the hand during observation of the static limb. Moreover, in the same condition, we found that passive observation of the avatar's actions induced a decrease in both FO and VA. We replicated the same results in a second study (experiment 2) where we investigated the modulation of FO and VA by comparing the visual body discontinuity with a condition in which the virtual limb was partially occluded. Our data show that mere observation of limb discontinuity can change a person's ownership and agency over a virtual body observed from a first-person perspective, even in the absence of any multisensory stimulation of the real body. These results shed new light on the role of body visual continuity in modulating self-awareness and agency in immersive virtual reality.",
   "Psychiatric and neurologic aspects of war: an overview and perspective.\nThe growing number of soldiers returning home with psychiatric and neurologic disorders, notably posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI), underscores the need for an interdisciplinary framework for understanding the emergent consequences of combat. Among the challenges facing the scientific community is the development of effective treatment strategies for TBI from blast and other injuries, given the confounding effects of comorbid psychological symptoms on accurate diagnoses. At the individual level, emerging technologies-including virtual reality, the use of genetic biomarkers to inform treatment response, and new brain imaging methodology-are playing an important role in the development of differential therapeutics to best address a soldier's particular clinical needs. At the macro level, new approaches toward understanding the political, cultural, and ideological contexts of mass conflict, the decision to join in violence, and ways of preventing genocide are discussed.",
   "Graphical tactile displays for visually-impaired people.\nThis paper presents an up-to-date survey of graphical tactile displays. These devices provide information through the sense of touch. At best, they should display both text and graphics (text may be considered a type of graphic). Graphs made with shapeable sheets result in bulky items awkward to store and transport; their production is expensive and time-consuming and they deteriorate quickly. Research is ongoing for a refreshable tactile display that acts as an output device for a computer or other information source and can present the information in text and graphics. The work in this field has branched into diverse areas, from physiological studies to technological aspects and challenges. Moreover, interest in these devices is now being shown by other fields such as virtual reality, minimally invasive surgery and teleoperation. It is attracting more and more people, research and money. Many proposals have been put forward, several of them succeeding in the task of presenting tactile information. However, most are research prototypes and very expensive to produce commercially. Thus the goal of an efficient low-cost tactile display for visually-impaired people has not yet been reached.",
   "Risk perception during urban cycling: An assessment of crowdsourced and authoritative data.\nSubjective risk perception during urban cycling has been mostly investigated through questionnaire studies. However, newly available data sources promise extended possibilities for the investigation and understanding of the underlying factors. We validate the rationale for using both opportunistically available crowd-sourced data (i.e., volunteered geographic information or VGI) as well as more established but rarely investigated authoritative data as predictors of subjective cycling risk. We achieve this by correlating indicators of cycling risk extracted from both VGI and authoritative data for two different German cities with participants' risk estimates assessed in laboratory-based virtual reality experiments. In Case 1, 15 participants (mostly undergraduate students with a mean age of 22 years old; nine of them females) were tested as a sample representing frequent and experienced cyclists, but unfamiliar with the 19 tested locations and less likely to be affected by the virtual reality setup. In Case 2, 24 new participants (mostly undergraduate students; mean age 24 years; 13 of them females) were experienced cyclists and mostly familiar with the 40 test locations located in their city of residence. For both cases, our findings provide evidence that parameters extracted from VGI (e.g., the semantic severity of the contribution and the reception by other citizens) as well as from authoritative data sources (e.g., accident statistics or Space Syntax measures) represent valid indicators for the subjectively perceived risk of cycling at a specific location. On the basis of this validation, future research can use these data sources to investigate the sources of risk perception during urban cycling in greater detail.",

   "Using video simulations and virtual reality to improve decision-making skills in basketball.\nA large body of literature supports the effectiveness of using video simulations to improve decision-making skills in invasion sports. However, whether these improvements are transferable (from the laboratory to the court/field) and generalizable (from trained to untrained plays) remains unknown. In addition, it remains to be determined whether presenting the video simulations using virtual reality provides an added-value. To investigate these questions, varsity-level basketball players underwent four training sessions during which they observed video clips of basketball plays presented either on a computer screen (CS group) or using a virtual reality headset (VR group). A third group watched footage from NCAA playoff games on a computer screen (CTRL group). Decision-making was assessed on-court before and after the training sessions using two types of plays: \"trained\" plays (presented during the CS and VR training sessions) and \"untrained\" plays (presented only during the on-court tests). When facing the trained plays in the posttest, both VR and CS groups significantly outperformed the CTRL group. In contrast, when facing the untrained plays, the VR group outperformed both the CS and CTRL groups. Our results indicate that CS training leads to transferable but non-generalized decision-making gains while VR training leads to transferable and generalized gains.",

   "A preliminary study of presence in virtual reality training simulation for medical emergencies.\nIn this paper, a preliminary study of presence in a training simulation for medical emergency based on virtual reality is presented. We explore the influence of interaction mechanisms, as well as the complexity of behaviours in the subjective sense of presence. As expected, it has been found that as the type of interaction is more natural, and the patient behaviour modelling is more complex, the achieved sense of presence is greater. However our results also show that the degree of presence depends more upon the complexity of patient modelling than on how natural the interaction is. Hence, we postulate that a proper patient modelling could elicit a high degree of presence, even with traditional interaction mechanisms.",
   "Phantom-based multimodal interactions for medical education and training: the Munich Knee Joint Simulator.\nSimulation environments based on virtual reality technologies can support medical education and training. In this paper, the novel approach of an \"interactive phantom\" is presented that allows a realistic display of haptic contact information typically generated when touching and moving human organs or segments. The key idea of the haptic interface is to attach passive phantom objects to a mechanical actuator. The phantoms look and feel as real anatomical objects. Additional visualization of internal anatomical and physiological information and sound generated during the interaction with the phantom yield a multimodal approach that can increase performance, didactic value, and immersion into the virtual environment. Compared to classical approaches, this multimodal display is convenient to use, provides realistic tactile properties, and can be partly adjusted to different, e.g., pathological properties. The interactive phantom is exemplified by a virtual human knee joint that can support orthopedic education, especially for the training of clinical knee joint evaluation. It is suggested that the technical principle can be transferred to many other fields of medical education and training such as obstetrics and dentistry.",

   "Impaired allocentric spatial memory underlying topographical disorientation.\nThe cognitive processes supporting spatial navigation are considered in the context of a patient (CF) with possible very early Alzheimer's disease who presents with topographical disorientation. Her verbal memory and her recognition memory for unknown buildings, landmarks and outdoor scenes was intact, although she showed an impairment in face processing. By contrast, her navigational ability, quantitatively assessed within a small virtual reality (VR) town, was significantly impaired. Interestingly, she showed a selective impairment in a VR object-location memory test whenever her viewpoint was shifted between presentation and test, but not when tested from the same viewpoint. We suggest that a specific impairment in locating objects relative to the environment rather than relative to the perceived viewpoint (i.e. allocentric rather than egocentric spatial memory) underlies her topographical disorientation. We discuss the likely neural bases of this deficit in the light of related studies in humans and animals, focusing on the hippocampus and related areas. The specificity of our test indicates a new way of assessing topographical disorientation, with possible application to the assessment of progressive dementias such as Alzheimer's disease.",
   "Virtual laboratory simulation in the education of laboratory technicians-motivation and study intensity.\nThis study presents an evaluation of virtual laboratory simulation for educational use in the AP Degree Programme in Chemical and Biotechnical Science at University College Copenhagen in Denmark. The purpose was to test if, and how, virtual laboratory simulation could be applied to a practically oriented education such as the education of laboratory technicians-the aim being to motivate students and improve the education with new teaching tools. The study investigated how specific virtual lab simulation cases (Labster-cases) may stimulate motivation, study intensity, and learning among laboratory technician students. Altogether, 78 students evaluated different educational aspects of using virtual lab cases in relation to a 2-week course within gene technology. Overall, students were positive regarding the use of laboratory simulation as well as the specific cases tested. The study showed that virtual lab simulation seems to help laboratory technician students connect theory with practice and to visualize molecular processes as well as practical laboratory procedures and instrument techniques, however, it did also pose technical challenges. Furthermore, the study indicated that the use of virtual lab simulation cases can contribute to increased study activity as well as motivation. The overall conclusion of this study was that virtual lab simulation is an effective supplement to traditional teaching activities for the education of lab technicians.",
   "Multisensory integration in the estimation of walked distances.\nWhen walking through space, both dynamic visual information (optic flow) and body-based information (proprioceptive and vestibular) jointly specify the magnitude of distance travelled. While recent evidence has demonstrated the extent to which each of these cues can be used independently, less is known about how they are integrated when simultaneously present. Many studies have shown that sensory information is integrated using a weighted linear sum, yet little is known about whether this holds true for the integration of visual and body-based cues for travelled distance perception. In this study using Virtual Reality technologies, participants first travelled a predefined distance and subsequently matched this distance by adjusting an egocentric, in-depth target. The visual stimulus consisted of a long hallway and was presented in stereo via a head-mounted display. Body-based cues were provided either by walking in a fully tracked free-walking space (Exp. 1) or by being passively moved in a wheelchair (Exp. 2). Travelled distances were provided either through optic flow alone, body-based cues alone or through both cues combined. In the combined condition, visually specified distances were either congruent (1.0\u00d7) or incongruent (0.7\u00d7 or 1.4\u00d7) with distances specified by body-based cues. Responses reflect a consistent combined effect of both visual and body-based information, with an overall higher influence of body-based cues when walking and a higher influence of visual cues during passive movement. When comparing the results of Experiments 1 and 2, it is clear that both proprioceptive and vestibular cues contribute to travelled distance estimates during walking. These observed results were effectively described using a basic linear weighting model.",
   "Virtual Reality Therapy Controlled Study for War Veterans with PTSD. Preliminary Results.\nMore than 30 years after signing truces, there are still around 20,000 Portuguese war veterans that fill PTSD (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) diagnose criteria. Despite many of them attending therapy, the outcome is not cheerful. In this way, a research protocol was devised to investigate the opportunity of adopting virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) to reduce PTSD symptomathology. This protocol consists on a controlled study (VRET vs. traditional psychotherapy vs. waiting list), where in the VRET condition patients will be graded by being exposed to a virtual reality jungle scenario. The activating episodes, that are comprised of three cues (ambush, mortar blasting and waiting for injured rescue), are repeated 3 times each session. The cues' intensity and frequency increase from session to session. Patients are exposed to the VR world through a HMD (Head Mounted Display). This paper reports on the ongoing research where 4 VRET patients that filled CAPS DSM-IV PTSD criteria were assessed at pretreatment and at the middle of treatment (5th session). Results from IES and SCL-90R dimensions showed no statistical significant differences between assessments, with exception to obsession-compulsion dimension of SCL-90R (F(1;3)=21.235; p<.05), indicating a decrease in obsessive thoughts. However, through descriptive analysis, it was observed a reduction in all IES and SCL-90R dimensions, except for hostility and psychoticism of SCL-90R.",
   "Postural adjustment response to depth direction moving patterns produced by virtual reality graphics.\nHuman posture is controlled by a combination of vestibular, somatosensory and visual information. This paper is concerned with postural readjustment responses induced by vection. In the visual control of posture, visually-induced perception of self-motion plays an important role and is called vection. Vection is difficult to measure quantitatively because it is a highly subjective phenomenon.",
   "A rehabilitation tool for functional balance using altered gravity and virtual reality.\nThere is a need for effective and early functional rehabilitation of patients with gait and balance problems including those with spinal cord injury, neurological diseases and recovering from hip fractures, a common consequence of falls especially in the elderly population. Gait training in these patients using partial body weight support (BWS) on a treadmill, a technique that involves unloading the subject through a harness, improves walking better than training with full weight bearing. One problem with this technique not commonly acknowledged is that the harness provides external support that essentially eliminates associated postural adjustments (APAs) required for independent gait. We have developed a device to address this issue and conducted a training study for proof of concept of efficacy.",
   "3-Dimensional Echocardiography: Latest Developments and Future Directions.\nThe ongoing refinements in 3-dimensional (3D) echocardiography technology continue to expand the scope of this imaging modality in clinical cardiology by offering new features that stem from the ability to image the heart in its complete dimensionality.

   "Virtual-reality distraction and cold-pressor pain tolerance: does avatar point of view matter?\nThis study tested the effects of distraction using virtual-reality (VR) technology on acute pain tolerance in young adults. Forty-one undergraduate students, aged 18-23 years, used a VR head-mounted display helmet, steering wheel, and foot pedal to play an auto racing video game while undergoing exposure to very cold water (cold pressor set at 1 \u00b0C). Two different game views were tested that were hypothesized to affect the degree to which participants felt \"present\" in the virtual environment: a first-person view, in which the participant saw the virtual environment through the eyes of the game character being manipulated; and a third-person view, in which the participant viewed the game character from a distance. The length of time participants tolerated the cold-water exposure (pain tolerance) under each distraction condition was compared to a baseline (no distraction) trial. Subjects also rated the degree to which they felt \"present\" in the virtual environment after each distraction trial. Results demonstrated that participants had significantly higher pain tolerance during both VR-distraction conditions relative to baseline (no distraction) trials. Although participants reported a greater sense of presence during the first-person condition than the third-person condition, pain-tolerance scores associated with the two distraction conditions did not differ. The types of VR applications in which presence may be more or less important are discussed.",

   "Timing and correction of stepping movements with a virtual reality avatar.\nResearch into the ability to coordinate one's movements with external cues has focussed on the use of simple rhythmic, auditory and visual stimuli, or interpersonal coordination with another person. Coordinating movements with a virtual avatar has not been explored, in the context of responses to temporal cues. To determine whether cueing of movements using a virtual avatar is effective, people's ability to accurately coordinate with the stimuli needs to be investigated. Here we focus on temporal cues, as we know from timing studies that visual cues can be difficult to follow in the timing context. Real stepping movements were mapped onto an avatar using motion capture data. Healthy participants were then motion captured whilst stepping in time with the avatar's movements, as viewed through a virtual reality headset. The timing of one of the avatar step cycles was accelerated or decelerated by 15% to create a temporal perturbation, for which participants would need to correct to, in order to remain in time. Step onset times of participants relative to the corresponding step-onsets of the avatar were used to measure the timing errors (asynchronies) between them. Participants completed either a visual-only condition, or auditory-visual with footstep sounds included, at two stepping tempo conditions (Fast: 400ms interval, Slow: 800ms interval). Participants' asynchronies exhibited slow drift in the Visual-Only condition, but became stable in the Auditory-Visual condition. Moreover, we observed a clear corrective response to the phase perturbation in both the fast and slow tempo auditory-visual conditions. We conclude that an avatar's movements can be used to influence a person's own motion, but should include relevant auditory cues congruent with the movement to ensure a suitable level of entrainment is achieved. This approach has applications in physiotherapy, where virtual avatars present an opportunity to provide the guidance to assist patients in adhering to prescribed exercises.",
   "Creating 3D models from Radiologic Images for Virtual Reality Medical Education Modules.\nVirtual Reality (VR) is a powerful tool that has increasingly being used by medical field in recent years. It has been mainly used surgical training in particular laparoscopic procedures. VR can be used for the teaching of anatomy. The aim of the study is to show application of transforming 2D radiologic images into 3D model by using thresholding and segmentation and import into VR interface at an affordable cost. Four anatomy modules are created with inputs to control the rotational and translational movement of 3D models in the virtual space. These movements allow users to explore 3D models by using head tilt and gaze input. 3D models of the Circle of Willis, Vertebral Aneurysm, Spine, and Skull are rendered in the user's field of view at runtime. VR is constructed to have many potentials uses in radiology education. Visualization of 3D anatomic structures in a virtual environment give another tool for teaching to students and patients about anatomy of the body. Four anatomy modules described here demonstrate example user interaction patterns best suited for viewing contexts. Instead viewing stacked 2D images or 3D models confined to desktop applications, virtual reality increases user interactivity of education. An intuitive understanding of anatomic structures in 3D space enhances the learning experience for medical students, residents, and patients we are treating.",
   "Use of virtual reality as a learning environment in dentistry.\nSecond Life (SL) is an online virtual world with a social environment that may serve as a valuable learning supplement to traditional preclinical teaching methods. The educational advantages of this virtual world include immersion and interactivity. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of using 3-dimensional interactive platforms (3DIPs) designed in SL to that of traditional teaching methods for developing students' understanding of dental clinical situations that are difficult to simulate in real life. For this study, 3DIPs were developed to compare the acquisition of 3 learning objectives: understanding concepts, procedural aspects of interaction with the patient, and spatial interpretation of anatomical structure interactions. A representative dental topic, the use of a semiadjustable articulator, was selected. A quasi-experimental design with 2 groups and pretest-posttest comparison was used. The students in the control group received the conventional teaching established for the subject, which does not include SL experiences. The students in the experimental group received conventional instruction and had access to all 3DIPs for 4 weeks without limitation. The pretest and posttest consisted of a multiple-choice test with 20 questions. A Student t test was used to compare the test results of the groups (significance level \u03b1 = 0.05). The posttest scores for the understanding of concepts and spatial interpretation were significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group (P < 0.05). However, there was no statistically significant difference between groups in posttest scores on the topic of procedural aspects. Students who used cooperative methods for acquisition of knowledge were observed to be highly motivated. The results suggest that the SL environment helps students to understand anatomical interactions that are difficult to observe in real life, is attractive to students, and contains tools with high didactic potential.",
   "Evidence for motor simulation in imagined locomotion.\nA series of experiments examined the role of the motor system in imagined movement, finding a strong relationship between imagined walking performance and the biomechanical information available during actual walking. Experiments 1 through 4 established the finding that real and imagined locomotion differ in absolute walking time. We then tested whether executed actions could provide a basis for imagined walking rate using 2 approaches. Experiments 5 and 6 used a perceptual-motor recalibration paradigm, finding that after physically walking in a treadmill virtual reality environment, actors recalibrated the time to imagine walking to a previously viewed target. This finding mirrors previous perceptual-motor recalibration work measuring actual walking to previously viewed targets. Experiments 7 and 8 used a dual-task paradigm in which actions performed concurrently with imagined walking increased the similarity between real and imagined walking time, but only when they were biomechanically consistent with the act of walking. The striking influence of biomechanical information on imagined locomotion provides evidence for shared motor systems in imagined and executed movements and is also directly relevant to the mechanisms involved in egocentric spatial updating of environmental layout.",
   "Balancing sensory inputs: Sensory reweighting of ankle proprioception and vision during a bipedal posture task.\nDuring multisensory integration, it has been proposed that the central nervous system (CNS) assigns a weight to each sensory input through a process called sensory reweighting. The outcome of this integration process is a single percept that is used to control posture. The main objective of this study was to determine the interaction between ankle proprioception and vision during sensory integration when the two inputs provide conflicting sensory information pertaining to direction of body sway. Sensory conflict was created by using bilateral Achilles tendon vibration and contracting visual flow and produced body sway in opposing directions when applied independently. Vibration was applied at 80Hz, 1mm amplitude and the visual flow consisted of a virtual reality scene with concentric rings retreating at 3m/s. Body sway elicited by the stimuli individually and in combination was evaluated in 10 healthy young adults by analyzing center of pressure (COP) displacement and lower limb kinematics. The magnitude of COP displacement produced when vibration and visual flow were combined was found to be lesser than the algebraic sum of COP displacement produced by the stimuli when applied individually. This suggests that multisensory integration is not merely an algebraic summation of individual cues. Instead the observed response might be a result of a weighted combination process with the weight attached to each cue being directly proportional to the relative reliability of the cues. The moderating effect of visual flow on postural instability produced by vibration points to the potential use of controlled visual flow for balance training.",
   "Enhancing Nursing Education Through Affordable and Realistic Holographic Mixed Reality: The Virtual Standardized Patient for Clinical Simulation.\nNurses serve a valuable role in the healthcare industry. Nurses are trained with the skills and knowledge to thrive in a fast-paced, evolving environment. In order to meet the complex and diverse needs of patients, nurses must be able to assess and prioritize care to produce safe and high-quality outcomes. Simulation is an established method of educating nursing students and preparing nurses to respond appropriately to situations they are likely to encounter in practice. Traditional nursing simulation devices are prohibitively expensive for many nursing education institutions. The development of augmented, mixed, and virtual reality simulation delivery offers a new platform for simulation, known as immersive simulation. Immersive simulation can virtually place nursing students in situations that are difficult to arrange in actual clinical practicums or that occur rarely but for which nurses need to be prepared. Additionally, the hardware required to deliver immersive simulation is much cheaper than that of traditional nursing simulation devices. This chapter describes the virtual standardized patient application delivered via mixed reality immersive simulation. This chapter also discusses the research initiative currently underway to assess student perceptions to this modality of health training simulation.",
   "Towards a Machine-Learning Approach for Sickness Prediction in 360\u00b0 Stereoscopic Videos.\nVirtual reality systems are widely believed to be the next major computing platform. There are, however, some barriers to adoption that must be addressed, such as that of motion sickness - which can lead to undesirable symptoms including postural instability, headaches, and nausea. Motion sickness in virtual reality occurs as a result of moving visual stimuli that cause users to perceive self-motion while they remain stationary in the real world. There are several contributing factors to both this perception of motion and the subsequent onset of sickness, including field of view, motion velocity, and stimulus depth. We verify first that differences in vection due to relative stimulus depth remain correlated with sickness. Then, we build a dataset of stereoscopic 3D videos and their corresponding sickness ratings in order to quantify their nauseogenicity, which we make available for future use. Using this dataset, we train a machine learning algorithm on hand-crafted features (quantifying speed, direction, and depth as functions of time) from each video, learning the contributions of these various features to the sickness ratings. Our predictor generally outperforms a na\u00efve estimate, but is ultimately limited by the size of the dataset. However, our result is promising and opens the door to future work with more extensive datasets. This and further advances in this space have the potential to alleviate developer and end user concerns about motion sickness in the increasingly commonplace virtual world.",
   "Speech Recognition in Nonnative versus Native English-Speaking College Students in a Virtual Classroom.\nLimited attention has been given to the effects of classroom acoustics at the college level. Many studies have reported that nonnative speakers of English are more likely to be affected by poor room acoustics than native speakers. An important question is how classroom acoustics affect speech perception of nonnative college students.",
   "Quantitative measurement of interocular suppression in children with amblyopia.\nIn this study we explored the possibility of using a dichoptic global motion technique to measure interocular suppression in children with amblyopia. We compared children (5-16 years old) with unilateral anisometropic and/or strabismic amblyopia to age-matched control children. Under dichoptic viewing conditions, contrast interference thresholds were determined with a global motion direction-discrimination task. Using virtual reality goggles, high contrast signal dots were presented to the amblyopic eye, while low contrast noise dots were presented to the non-amblyopic fellow eye. The contrast of the noise dots was increased until discrimination of the motion direction of the signal dots reached chance performance. Contrast interference thresholds were significantly lower in the strabismic group than in the anisometropic and control group. Our results suggest that interocular suppression is stronger in strabismic than in anisometropic amblyopia.",
   "Virtual reality triage training provides a viable solution for disaster-preparedness.\nThe objective of this study was to compare the relative impact of two simulation-based methods for training emergency medicine (EM) residents in disaster triage using the Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment (START) algorithm, full-immersion virtual reality (VR), and standardized patient (SP) drill. Specifically, are there differences between the triage performances and posttest results of the two groups, and do both methods differentiate between learners of variable experience levels?",

The text provides not only a historical lens to the evolution of the imaging technologies that are part of routine contemporary practice but also provides a detailed sketch of emerging imaging technologies, such as endoscopic and exoscopic systems. Augmented reality, virtual reality, and mixed reality are new technologies that have enhanced the preparation of surgery and provide excellent case-specific training modules to break down each step of an operation in isolation.",
   "Scaffolding clinical reasoning of medical students with virtual patients: effects on diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and errors.\nBackground Understanding clinical reasoning is a major challenge in medical education research. Little is known about the influence of scaffolding and feedback on the clinical reasoning of medical students. The aim of this study was to measure the effects of problem representation (cognitive representation of a clinical case) and structured scaffolding for reflection with or without feedback on the diagnostic efficiency and characterization of diagnostic errors of medical students. Methods One hundred and forty-eight advanced medical students were randomly assigned to one of five groups (2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 design with a control group). They worked on 15 virtual clinical cases (five learning cases, five initial assessment cases, and five delayed assessment cases) in an electronic learning environment. After each case, they stated their presumed diagnosis and explained their diagnostic conclusion. Diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and error distribution were analyzed. Results The diagnostic accuracy (number of correctly solved cases) and efficiency (solved cases/total time) did not differ significantly between any of the groups in the two different assessment phases [mean\u2009=\u20092.2-3.3 (standard deviation [SD]\u2009=\u20090.79-1.31), p\u2009=\u20090.08/0.27 and mean\u2009=\u20090.07-0.12 (SD\u2009=\u20090.04-0.08), p\u2009=\u20090.16/0.32, respectively]. The most important causes for diagnostic errors were a lack of diagnostic skills (20%), a lack of knowledge (18%), and premature closure (17%). Conclusions Neither structured reflections nor representation scaffolding improved diagnostic accuracy or efficiency of medical students compared to a control group when working with virtual patients.",

   "FRACAS: a system for computer-aided image-guided long bone fracture surgery.\nThis article describes FRACAS, a computer-integrated orthopedic system for assisting surgeons in performing closed medullary nailing of long bone fractures. FRACAS's goal is to reduce the surgeon's cumulative exposure to radiation and surgical complications associated with alignment and positioning errors of bone fragments, nail insertion, and distal screw locking. It replaces uncorrelated, static fluoroscopic images with a virtual reality display of three-dimensional bone models created from preoperative computed tomography and tracked intraoperatively in real time. Fluoroscopic images are used to register the bone models to the intraoperative situation and to verify that the registration is maintained. This article describes the system concept, software prototypes of preoperative modules (modeling, nail selection, and visualization), intraoperative modules (fluoroscopic image processing and tracking), and preliminary in vitro experimental results to date. Our experiments suggest that the modeling, nail selection, and visualization modules yield adequate results and that fluoroscopic image processing with submillimetric accuracy is practically feasible on clinical images.",
   "Improved region of interest selection and colocalization analysis in three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy samples using virtual reality.\nAlthough modern fluorescence microscopy produces detailed three-dimensional (3D) datasets, colocalization analysis and region of interest (ROI) selection is most commonly performed two-dimensionally (2D) using maximum intensity projections (MIP). However, these 2D projections exclude much of the available data. Furthermore, 2D ROI selections cannot adequately select complex 3D structures which may inadvertently lead to either the exclusion of relevant or the inclusion of irrelevant data points, consequently affecting the accuracy of the colocalization analysis. Using a virtual reality (VR) enabled system, we demonstrate that 3D visualization, sample interrogation and analysis can be achieved in a highly controlled and precise manner. We calculate several key colocalization metrics using both 2D and 3D derived super-resolved structured illumination-based data sets. Using a neuronal injury model, we investigate the change in colocalization between Tau and acetylated \u03b1-tubulin at control conditions, after 6 hours and again after 24 hours. We demonstrate that performing colocalization analysis in 3D enhances its sensitivity, leading to a greater number of statistically significant differences than could be established when using 2D methods. Moreover, by carefully delimiting the 3D structures under analysis using the 3D VR system, we were able to reveal a time dependent loss in colocalization between the Tau and microtubule network as an early event in neuronal injury. This behavior could not be reliably detected using a 2D based projection. We conclude that, using 3D colocalization analysis, biologically relevant samples can be interrogated and assessed with greater precision, thereby better exploiting the potential of fluorescence-based image analysis in biomedical research.",

   "Comparison of a virtual reality simulator and simulated limbs for phlebotomy training.\nThe current study compared the CathSim virtual reality simulator with simulated limbs for phlebotomy training. In the first experiment, medical students completed two 1-hour training sessions using 1 of the 2 methods. Afterward, the students' performance was assessed with both simulated limbs and genuine patients. The results showed that students trained with the simulated limbs achieved higher scores on both the posttest and the field test with actual patients than those trained on the CathSim system. In the second study, graduate students practiced with the CathSim system for 5 hours. The results showed a significant improvement in scores from pretest to posttest for these students. However, even after extended practice, their final scores did not differ from those of the medical students in the first experiment. Critical differences in design characteristics between the 2 systems may explain these findings. Although the authors observed a clear advantage for simulated limbs over the CathSim system, neither system faithfully represents all of steps needed to perform the procedure. Thus, training decisions may require that the unique advantages afforded by each system be considered.",
   "Unilateral temporal lobectomy patients show lateralized topographical and episodic memory deficits in a virtual town.\nA large-scale virtual reality town was used to test the topographical and episodic memory of patients with unilateral temporal lobe damage. Seventeen right and 13 left temporal lobectomy patients were compared with 16 healthy matched control subjects. After they had explored the town, subjects' topographical memory was tested by requiring them to navigate to specific locations in the town. The ability to recognize scenes from and draw maps of the virtual town was also assessed. Following the topographical memory tests, subjects followed a route around the same town but now collected objects from two different characters in two different locations. Episodic memory for various aspects of these events was then assessed by paired forced-choice recognition tests. The results showed an interaction between laterality and test type such that the right temporal lobectomy (RTL) patients were worse on tests of topographical memory, and the left temporal lobectomy (LTL) patients worse on tests of context-dependent episodic memory. Specifically, the RTL group was impaired on navigation, scene recognition and map drawing relative to control subjects. They were also impaired on recognition of objects in the episodic memory task. The LTL group was impaired relative to control subjects on their memory for contextual aspects of the events, such as who gave them the objects, the order in which objects were received and the locations in which they received them. They were also mildly impaired on topographical memory, but less so than the RTL group. These results suggest that topographical memory is predominately mediated by structures in the right medial temporal lobe, whereas the context-dependent aspects of episodic memory in this non-verbal test are more dependent on the left medial temporal lobe.",
   "Laparoscopic surgical education--the experience of the first surgical unit Ia\u015fi.\nThe classic apprenticeship model for surgical training takes place into the operating theater under the strict coordination of a senior surgeon. During the time and especially after the introduction of minimally invasive techniques as gold standard treatment for many diseases, other methods were developed to successful fulfill the well known three stages of training: skill-based behavior, rule-based behavior and knowledge-based behavior. The skills needed for minimally invasive surgery aren't easily obtained using classical apprenticeship model due to ethical, medico-legal and economic considerations. In this way several types of simulators have been developed. Nowadays simulators are worldwide accepted for laparoscopic surgical training and provide formative feedback which allows an improvement of the performances of the young surgeons. The simulators currently used allow assimilating only skill based behavior and rule-based behavior. However, the training using animal models as well as new virtual reality simulators and augmented reality offer the possibility to achieve knowledge-based behavior. However it isn't a worldwide accepted laparoscopic training curriculum. We present our experience with different types of simulators and teaching methods used along the time in our surgical unit. We also performed a review of the literature data.",

   "Neural correlates of encoding space from route and survey perspectives.\nThe neural mechanisms underlying ground-level spatial navigation have been investigated, but little is known about other kinds of spatial navigation. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to identify differences in brain activation for two types of spatial information, information from the ground-level perspective (route) and information from a global perspective (survey). Participants were scanned during the encoding of two different virtual reality environments, one from each perspective. Comparisons of brain activation during route and survey encoding suggested that both types of information recruited a common network of brain areas, but with important differences. Survey encoding recruited a subset of areas recruited by route encoding, but with greater activation in some areas, including inferior temporal cortex and posterior superior parietal cortex. Route encoding, in contrast, recruited regions that were not activated by survey encoding, including medial temporal lobe structures, anterior superior parietal cortex, and postcentral gyrus. These differences in brain activation are associated with differences in memory performance for the two types of spatial information and contribute to specification of brain components of spatial knowledge.",
   "You Spin my Head Right Round: Threshold of Limited Immersion for Rotation Gains in Redirected Walking.\nIn virtual environments, the space that can be explored by real walking is limited by the size of the tracked area. To enable unimpeded walking through large virtual spaces in small real-world surroundings, redirection techniques are used. These unnoticeably manipulate the user's virtual walking trajectory. It is important to know how strongly such techniques can be applied without the user noticing the manipulation-or getting cybersick. Previously, this was estimated by measuring a detection threshold (DT) in highly-controlled psychophysical studies, which experimentally isolate the effect but do not aim for perceived immersion in the context of VR applications. While these studies suggest that only relatively low degrees of manipulation are tolerable, we claim that, besides establishing detection thresholds, it is important to know when the user's immersion breaks. We hypothesize that the degree of unnoticed manipulation is significantly different from the detection threshold when the user is immersed in a task. We conducted three studies: a) to devise an experimental paradigm to measure the threshold of limited immersion (TLI), b) to measure the TLI for slowly decreasing and increasing rotation gains, and c) to establish a baseline of cybersickness for our experimental setup. For rotation gains greater than 1.0, we found that immersion breaks quite late after the gain is detectable. However, for gains lesser than 1.0, some users reported a break of immersion even before established detection thresholds were reached. Apparently, the developed metric measures an additional quality of user experience. This article contributes to the development of effective spatial compression methods by utilizing the break of immersion as a benchmark for redirection techniques.",

   "Monitoring system for the totally implantable ventricular assist system by use of sensors for virtual reality.\nFor the development of the totally implantable artificial organs, it is an important problem to monitor the conditions of the implantable devices, especially when used in clinical cases. In this study we used position sensors for the 3-dimensional (3-D) virtual reality (VR) system monitor an implantable artificial heart. The sensors used in the experiments were 3-space Fastrak (Polhemus, USA). The position sensors using electro-magnetic forces were attached to the inner actuating zone. Sensitivity of the position sensors was in the order of around 0.8 mm. By use of these VR position sensors, we could easily detect the six degrees of freedom as x,y,z, and pitch, yaw, roll of these sensors. Experimental evaluation using a model circulation loop and healthy adult goats was performed. Experimental results suggest that our newly developed implantable sensors for monitoring the implantable artificial heart system were useful for sensing driving condition, thus possibly useful for the implantable devices for clinical usage.",
   "Teaching Otolaryngology skills through simulation.\nOver the last couple of decades, learning through simulation has become popularised for various reasons and is continuing to expand exponentially despite a lack of robust evidence that it actually improves outcomes for patients and learners. There has been a particular growth in the use of high-fidelity virtual reality simulators for surgical training as the technology has become more affordable. In the field of Otolaryngology, simulation appears to help teach simple procedural skills through to complex surgery of the temporal bone and paranasal sinuses. This is happening in an era when quality of care and patient safety are top of the agenda and cadaveric material is in short supply. In this article, we explore the history behind simulation, review the available evidence and discuss its applications within Otolaryngology.",
   "Use of virtual reality distraction to reduce claustrophobia symptoms during a mock magnetic resonance imaging brain scan: a case report.\nThe present case series with two patients explored whether virtual reality (VR) distraction could reduce claustrophobia symptoms during a mock magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Two patients who met DSM-IV criteria for specific phobia, situational type (i.e., claustrophobia) reported high levels of anxiety during a mock 10-min MRI procedure with no VR, and asked to terminate the scan early. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either VR or music distraction for their second scan attempt. When immersed in an illusory three-dimensional (3D) virtual world named SnowWorld, patient 1 was able to complete a 10-min mock scan with low anxiety and reported an increase in self-efficacy afterwards. Patient 2 received \"music only\" distraction during her second scan but was still not able to complete a 10-min scan and asked to terminate her second scan early. These results suggest that immersive VR may prove effective at temporarily reducing claustrophobia symptoms during MRI scans and music may prove less effective.",
   "Augmented Reality Interface Design Approaches for Goal-directed and Stimulus-driven Driving Tasks.\nThe automotive industry is rapidly developing new in-vehicle technologies that can provide drivers with information to aid awareness and promote quicker response times. Particularly, vehicles with augmented reality (AR) graphics delivered via head-up displays (HUDs) are nearing mainstream commercial feasibility and will be widely implemented over the next decade. Though AR graphics have been shown to provide tangible benefits to drivers in scenarios like forward collision warnings and navigation, they also create many new perceptual and sensory issues for drivers. For some time now, designers have focused on increasing the realism and quality of virtual graphics delivered via HUDs, and recently have begun testing more advanced 3D HUD systems that deliver volumetric spatial information to drivers. However, the realization of volumetric graphics adds further complexity to the design and delivery of AR cues, and moreover, parameters in this new design space must be clearly and operationally defined and explored. In this work, we present two user studies that examine how driver performance and visual attention are affected when using fixed and animated AR HUD interface design approaches in driving scenarios that require top-down and bottom-up cognitive processing. Results demonstrate that animated design approaches can produce some driving gains (e.g., in goal-directed navigation tasks) but often come at the cost of response time and distance. Our discussion yields AR HUD design recommendations and challenges some of the existing assumptions of world-fixed conformal graphic approaches to design.",

   "Research on presence in virtual reality: a survey.\nVirtual Reality (VR) is starting to be used in psychological therapy around the world. However, a thorough understanding of the reason why VR is effective and what effect it has on the human psyche is still missing. Most research on this subject is related to the concept of presence. This paper gives an up-to-date overview of research in this diverse field. It starts with the most prevailing definitions and theories on presence, most of which attribute special roles for the mental process of attention and for mental models of the virtual space. A review of the phenomena thought to be effected by presence shows that there is still a strong need for research on this subject because little conclusive evidence exists regarding the relationship between presence and phenoma such as emotional responses to virtual stimuli. An investigation shows there has been substantial research for developing methods for measuring presence and research regarding factors that contribute to presence. Knowledge of these contributing factors can play a vital role in development of new VR applications, but key knowledge elements in this area are still missing.",

The skills necessary to perform robotic surgery are unique from those required in open and laparoscopic surgery. A validated laparoscopic surgical skills curriculum (Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery or FLS\u2122) has transformed the way surgeons acquire laparoscopic skills. There is a need for a similar skills training and assessment tool for robotic surgery. Our research group previously developed and validated a robotic training curriculum in a virtual reality (VR) simulator. We hypothesized that novice robotic surgeons could achieve proficiency levels defined by more experienced robotic surgeons on the VR robotic curriculum, and that this would result in improved performance on the actual daVinci Surgical System\u2122.",

The surgeon thereby wears a head-mounted unit with a binocular display, a head tracker, a microphone and earphones. Different view positioning and adjustment modes can be selected by voice and controlled by head rotation while pressing a miniature confirmation button with a finger.

The first labtype of the system was then implemented and demonstrated in the operating room on a phantom together with the clinical partners.",
   "Immersive Virtual Reality Field Trips Facilitate Learning About Climate Change.\nAcross four studies, two controlled lab experiments and two field studies, we tested the efficacy of immersive Virtual Reality (VR) as an education medium for teaching the consequences of climate change, particularly ocean acidification. Over 270 participants from four different learning settings experienced an immersive underwater world designed to show the process and effects of rising sea water acidity. In all of our investigations, after experiencing immersive VR people demonstrated knowledge gains or inquisitiveness about climate science and in some cases, displayed more positive attitudes toward the environment after comparing pre- and post-test assessments. The analyses also revealed a potential post-hoc mechanism for the learning effects, as the more that people explored the spatial learning environment, the more they demonstrated a change in knowledge about ocean acidification. This work is unique by showing distinct learning gains or an interest in learning across a variety of participants (high school, college students, adults), measures (learning gain scores, tracking data about movement in the virtual world, qualitative responses from classroom teachers), and content (multiple versions varying in length and content about climate change were tested). Our findings explicate the opportunity to use immersive VR for environmental education and to drive information-seeking about important social issues such as climate change.",
   "A Review of Endoscopic Simulation: Current Evidence on Simulators and Curricula.\nUpper and lower endoscopy is an important tool that is being utilized more frequently by general surgeons. Training in therapeutic endoscopic techniques has become a mandatory requirement for general surgery residency programs in the United States. The Fundamentals of Endoscopic Surgery has been developed to train and assess competency in these advanced techniques. Simulation has been shown to increase the skill and learning curve of trainees in other surgical disciplines. Several types of endoscopy simulators are commercially available; mechanical trainers, animal based, and virtual reality or computer-based simulators all have their benefits and limitations. However they have all been shown to improve trainee's endoscopic skills. Endoscopic simulators will play a critical role as part of a comprehensive curriculum designed to train the next generation of surgeons. We reviewed recent literature related to the various types of endoscopic simulators and their use in an educational curriculum, and discuss the relevant findings.",
   "Design of Virtual Guiding Tasks With Haptic Feedback for Assessing the Wrist Motor Function of Patients With Upper Motor Neuron Lesions.\nImpaired motor function is a common consequence of upper motor neuron lesions (UMNLs). Fine motor skills involved in small movements occurring in the fingers, hand, and wrist are usually regained by patient self-training at home. Most studies focus on the rehabilitation of the fingers but ignore the recovery of wrist motor function. In this paper, three virtual guiding tasks were designed to assess wrist motor functions, including the basic motor flexibility, motion stability, and a range of active motion. A haptic device was used to provide haptic feedback to users who performed virtual tasks in a virtual reality (VR) environment. In total, 46 healthy subjects and 10 UMNL patients were included to test the effectiveness of the designed tasks on improving wrist motor assessments. Quantitative performances, including the completion time, contact force, and motion trajectory, were automatically acquired during the tasks. Measurements for 95% of control subjects were used to establish normative references. Patient deficiencies in the wrist motor function were identified when their quantitative performances were outside the normative control ranges. The results suggest that the designed virtual tasks are sensitive for patients in the later period of rehabilitation, making the assessment suitable for using at home.",
   "[The overview of robot surgery].\nSurgical operations have developed in the method which skillful surgeon's hands and eyes are used. However, to realize a new surgical therapy in the 21st century, it is necessary to use various advanced technologies; surgical robots, three dimensional medical images, computer graphics, computer simulation technology and others. Three dimensional medical image for surgical operation provides surgeons with advanced vision. Surgical robots provide surgeons with advanced hand, but it is not a machine to do the same action of a surgeon using scissors or a scalpel. The advanced vision and hands available to surgeons are creating new surgical fields which are minimally invasive surgery, non-invasive surgery, virtual reality micro-surgery, tele-surgery, fetus surgery, neuro-informatics surgery and others in the 21st century.",

   "Road crossing decisions in real and virtual environments: A comparative study on simulator validity.\nVirtual reality (VR) is a valuable tool for the assessment of human perception and behavior in a risk-free environment. Investigators should, however, ensure that the used virtual environment is validated in accordance with the experiment's intended research question since behavior in virtual environments has been shown to differ to behavior in real environments. This article presents the street crossing decisions of 30 participants who were facing an approaching vehicle and had to decide at what moment it was no longer safe to cross, applying the step-back method. The participants executed the task in a real environment and also within a highly immersive VR setup involving a head-mounted display (HMD). The results indicate significant differences between the two settings regarding the participants' behaviors. The time-to-contact of approaching vehicles was significantly lower for crossing decisions in the virtual environment than for crossing decisions in the real one. Additionally, it was demonstrated that participants based their crossing decisions in the real environment on the temporal distance of the approaching vehicle (i.e., time-to-contact), whereas the crossing decisions in the virtual environment seemed to depend on the vehicle's spatial distance, neglecting the vehicle's velocity. Furthermore, a deeper analysis suggests that crossing decisions were not affected by factors such as the participant's gender or the order in which they faced the real and the virtual environment.",

   "The functional role of human right hippocampal/parahippocampal theta rhythm in environmental encoding during virtual spatial navigation.\nLow frequency theta band oscillations (4-8 Hz) are thought to provide a timing mechanism for hippocampal place cell firing and to mediate the formation of spatial memory. In rodents, hippocampal theta has been shown to play an important role in encoding a new environment during spatial navigation, but a similar functional role of hippocampal theta in humans has not been firmly established. To investigate this question, we recorded healthy participants' brain responses with a 160-channel whole-head MEG system as they performed two training sets of a virtual Morris water maze task. Environment layouts (except for platform locations) of the two sets were kept constant to measure theta activity during spatial learning in new and familiar environments. In line with previous findings, left hippocampal/parahippocampal theta showed more activation navigating to a hidden platform relative to random swimming. Consistent with our hypothesis, right hippocampal/parahippocampal theta was stronger during the first training set compared to the second one. Notably, theta in this region during the first training set correlated with spatial navigation performance across individuals in both training sets. These results strongly argue for the functional importance of right hippocampal theta in initial encoding of configural properties of an environment during spatial navigation. Our findings provide important evidence that right hippocampal/parahippocampal theta activity is associated with environmental encoding in the human brain. Hum Brain Mapp 38:1347-1361, 2017.",
   "Effects of laparoscopic instrument and finger on force perception: a first step towards laparoscopic force-skills training.\nIn laparoscopic surgery, no external feedback on the magnitude of the force exerted is available. Hence, surgeons and residents tend to exert excessive force, which leads to tissue trauma. Ability of surgeons and residents to perceive their own force output without external feedback is a critical factor in laparoscopic force-skills training. Additionally, existing methods of laparoscopic training do not effectively train residents and novices on force-skills. Hence, there is growing need for the development of force-based training curriculum.",
   "Efficacy of virtual reality exposure therapy in the treatment of PTSD: a systematic review.\nThe use of Information and Communication Technologies, such as virtual reality, has been employed in the treatment of anxiety disorders with the goal of augmenting exposure treatment, which is already considered to be the first-line treatment for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). To evaluate the efficacy of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) in the treatment of PTSD, we performed a systematic review of published articles using the following electronic databases: Web of Science, PubMed, PsycINFO, and PILOTS. Eligibility criteria included the use of patients diagnosed with PTSD according to DSM-IV, the use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and the use of virtual reality for performing exposure. 10 articles were selected, seven of which showed that VRET produced statistically significant results in comparison to the waiting list. However, no difference was found between VRET and exposure treatment. Of these 10, four were randomized, two were controlled but not randomized and four were non-controlled. The majority of the articles used head-mounted display virtual reality (VR) equipment and VR systems specific for the population that was being treated. Dropout rates do not seem to be lower than in traditional exposure treatment. However, there are a few limitations. Because this is a new field of research, there are few studies in the literature. There is also a need to standardize the number of sessions used. The randomized studies were analyzed to assess the quality of the methodology, and important deficiencies were noted, such as the non-use of intent-to- treat-analysis and the absence of description of possible concomitant treatments and comorbidities. Preliminary data suggest that VRET is as efficacious as traditional exposure treatment and can be especially useful in the treatment of patients who are resistant to traditional exposure.",
   "Extended Reality in Medical Education: Driving Adoption through Provider-Centered Design.\nSimulation is a widely used technique for medical education. Due to decreased training opportunities with real patients, and increased emphasis on both patient outcomes and remote access, demand has increased for more advanced, realistic simulation methods. Here, we discuss the increasing need for, and benefits of, extended (virtual, augmented, or mixed) reality throughout the continuum of medical education, from anatomy for medical students to procedures for residents. We discuss how to drive the adoption of mixed reality tools into medical school's anatomy, and procedural, curricula.",
   "[Development of virtual reality as an exposure technique].\nVirtual reality (VR) has been investigated as a\u00a0medium for exposure therapy of anxiety disorders for 20\u00a0years. Various meta-analyses have provided convincing evidence of the therapeutic efficacy of exposure therapy in VR.",
   "Improving the soundscape quality of urban areas exposed to aircraft noise by adding moving water and vegetation.\nResearch shows that the sight of trees and the sound of moving water improve the soundscape quality of outdoor spaces exposed to road traffic noise. Effects are attributed to non-energetic masking, visual attentional distortion, and congruence between sight and hearing. However, there is no literature on such effects for aircraft noise. Aircraft noise varies from other traffic sources, i.e., in terms temporal variability, duration, and spectral composition, complicating the application of findings without further research. In a virtual reality experiment reported in this article, participants were asked to rate scenarios with different sound levels of flyovers, urban typologies, vegetation, and/ or water features. The results showed a significant improvement of the soundscape quality when (1) vegetation and (2) moving water were present, and especially when (3) vegetation and moving water were presented simultaneously, especially for residential areas in terms of the relative change. Moving water also reduced the saliency of aircraft flyovers significantly, changing the constellation of fore- and background sounds. Moving water raised the perceived audibility of the most dominant sound source too, which could be attributed to non-energetic masking effects. The findings of this study indicate that soundscape strategies can complement noise abatement in areas prone to aircraft noise.",
   "An Auti-Sim Intervention: The Role of Perspective Taking in Combating Public Stigma with Virtual Simulations.\nPublic stigma associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) commonly stems from judgments surrounding sensory overload symptoms. As individuals try and make sense of observed disordered behaviors of those with ASD, they are quick to develop dispositional attributions instead of acknowledging situational instigators. Interventions aimed at educating the lay public that disordered actions are a result of a biological causes have been successful in lessening perceptions of responsibility, yet foster an out-group perspective allowing prejudice attitudes and discriminatory behaviors to persist. The present study examines the short-term effectiveness of engagement with a virtual simulation, Auti-Sim, to combat stigma by giving lay people a first-person experience of sensory overload. To assess Auti-Sim, a between-subject, in-laboratory experimental design was employed. A total of 123 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 interventions (virtual simulation engagement, observation of simulation engagement, or reading text vignettes). Participants completed a brief pretest questionnaire, encountered the intervention, and then completed a post-test questionnaire. Engagement with the virtual simulation resulted in heightened perspective taking, which subsequently increased emotional concern, helping intentions, and willingness to volunteer compared with the observation only or text vignette intervention. Positive attitudes toward those with ASD did not differ across interventions. Fostering a different understanding of disordered action through a virtual simulation has the potential to elicit perspective taking and subsequent empathetic outcomes. Perspective taking seems to encourage perceptions of in-group belonging rather than out-group categorization and thus might be a desired outcome for stigma-reducing efforts.",
   "Multimodal Learning in Health Sciences and Medicine: Merging Technologies to Enhance Student Learning and Communication.\nAdvances in consumer-level educational technologies show great promise for enhancing the learning experiences of students in health and medicine. There are particular benefits to\u00a0using a combination of various devices and technologies when teaching challenging concepts. These include augmented reality-enabled devices enriched with accompanying 3D printed models, or virtual reality sessions coupled with online quizzes or revision activities. Tablet applications can also be integrated while students engage\u00a0concurrently in desktop-based online learning. This mixing and merging of different technologies can allow educators to focus on the strengths of each device, while mitigating limitations arising from a single mode's stand-alone use. This chapter describes a series of options to integrate multiple digital modes when educating health\u00a0science and medical students using technology. It also presents the opportunity for health\u00a0professional program graduates to be trained in teaching using technology, as their future careers can be enhanced by an ability to educate effectively,\u00a0or from the skills\u00a0developed\u00a0when incorporating innovations such as serious games into a health curriculum. With the dynamic and ever-changing nature of health and medical education, educators can find great benefits when introducing multimodal digital learning into their respective courses.",
   "Real-time 3D avatars for tele-rehabilitation in virtual reality.\nWe present work in progress on a tele-immersion system for telerehabilitation using real-time stereo vision and virtual environments. Stereo reconstruction is used to capture user's 3D avatar in real time and project it into a shared virtual environment, enabling a patient and therapist to interact remotely. Captured data can also be used to analyze the movement and provide feedback to the patient as we present in a preliminary study of stepping-in-place task. Such tele-presence system could in the future allow patients to interact remotely with remote physical therapist and virtual environment while objectively tracking their performance.",
   "Comparison of results of virtual-reality simulator and training model for basic ureteroscopy training.\nThe traditional method of acquiring surgical skills is by apprenticeship and involves an extensive period of training with patients. Model-based and virtual reality simulation is gaining interest as alternative training, allowing repetitive practice in a low-risk environment. The objective of this study was to determine if a materials, model-based training format and an interactive virtual-reality simulator could provide equivalent teaching of basic ureteroscopy skills to the inexperienced medical student.",
   "Virtual reality cue reactivity assessment: a case study in a teen smoker.\nCigarette smoking in adolescents is a major public health problem. To address the increasing need for efficacious assessment and treatment methods, we developed and tested a novel virtual reality cue reactivity assessment system. A case study of a controlled virtual reality cue reactivity trial with a 17-year-old adolescent cigarette smoker is presented. During the trial, the participant was exposed to virtual reality (VR) smoking cues and VR neutral cues and assessments of subjective craving and skin conductance response (SCR) were recorded. Upon exposure to VR smoking cues, craving increased. A novel methodology for collecting and analyzing SCR in VR was developed and explored to expand the role of physiological variables in VR research. SCR data indicated specific reactions to smoking cue stimuli, with the subject experiencing increased reactivity to smoking cues (i.e., cigarettes) compared to food or drinks. Based on this case study, further research using VR cue reactivity assessment in adolescent smokers is warranted. The impact of VR in drug research and future applications in research are also discussed.",
   "Effects of virtual reality-based cognitive training in older adults living without and with mild dementia: a pretest-posttest design pilot study.\nModern technologies are increasingly used in the development of cognitive interventions for older adults. Research into possible applications of virtual reality in such interventions has begun only recently. The aim of present study was to evaluate the effects of 8 sessions of VR-based cognitive training using the GRADYS game in healthy older adults (n\u2009=\u200972; aged 60-88) and older adults living with mild dementia (n\u2009=\u200927; aged 60-89).",
   "Advanced modeling strategy for the analysis of heart valve leaflet tissue mechanics using high-order finite element method.\nModeling soft tissue using the finite element method is one of the most challenging areas in the field of biomechanical engineering. To date, many models have been developed to describe heart valve leaflet tissue mechanics, which are accurate to some extent. Nevertheless, there is no comprehensive method to modeling soft tissue mechanics, This is because (1) the degree of anisotropy in the heart valve leaflet changes layer by layer due to a variety of collagen fiber densities and orientations that cannot be taken into account in the model and also (2) a constitutive material model fully describing the mechanical properties of the leaflet structure is not available in the literature. In this framework, we develop a new high-order element using p-type finite element formulation to create anisotropic material properties similar to those of the heart valve leaflet tissue in only one single element. This element also takes the nonlinearity of the leaflet tissue into consideration using a bilinear material model. This new element is composed a two-dimensional finite element in the principal directions of leaflet tissue and a p-type finite element in the direction of thickness. The proposed element is easy to implement, much more efficient than standard elements available in commercial finite element packages. This study is one step towards the modeling of soft tissue mechanics using a meshless finite element approach to be applied in real-time haptic feedback of soft-tissue models in virtual reality simulation.",
   "Could virtual reality be effective in treating children with phobias?\nThe use of virtual reality to treat anxiety disorders in adults is gaining popularity and its efficacy is supported by numerous outcome studies. Similar research for children is lagging behind. The outcome studies on the use of virtual reality to treat anxiety disorders in children currently address only specific phobias, and all of the available trials are reviewed in this article. Despite the limited number of studies, results are very encouraging for the treatment of school and spider phobias. A study with adolescents suggests that, at least for social anxiety, exposure stimuli would be more effective if they were developed specifically for younger populations. Virtual reality may not increase children's motivation towards therapy unless their fearful apprehension is addressed before initiating the treatment.",
   "Three-dimensional virtual-reality surgical planning and soft-tissue prediction for orthognathic surgery.\nComplex maxillofacial malformations continue to present challenges in analysis and correction beyond modern technology. The purpose of this paper is to present a virtual-reality workbench for surgeons to perform virtual orthognathic surgical planning and soft-tissue prediction in three dimensions. A resulting surgical planning system, i.e., three-dimensional virtual-reality surgical-planning and soft-tissue prediction for orthognathic surgery, consists of four major stages: computed tomography (CT) data post-processing and reconstruction, three-dimensional (3-D) color facial soft-tissue model generation, virtual surgical planning and simulation, soft-tissue-change preoperative prediction. The surgical planning and simulation are based on a 3-D CT reconstructed bone model, whereas the soft-tissue prediction is based on color texture-mapped and individualized facial soft-tissue model. Our approach is able to provide a quantitative osteotomy-simulated bone model and prediction of postoperative appearance with photorealistic quality. The prediction appearance can be visualized from any arbitrary viewing point using a low-cost personal-computer-based system. This cost-effective solution can be easily adopted in any hospital for daily use.",
   "On a two-level multiclassifier system with error correction applied to the control of bioprosthetic hand.\nThe paper presents an advanced method of recognition of patient's intention to move of hand prosthesis. The proposed method is based on two-level multiclassifier system (MCS) with homogeneous base classifiers dedicated to EEG, EMG and MMG biosignals and with combining mechanism using a dynamic ensemble selection (DES) scheme and probabilistic competence function. Additionally, the feedback signal derived from the prosthesis sensors is applied to the correction of classification algorithm. The performance of MCS with proposed competence function and combining procedure were experimentally compared against three benchmark MCSs using real data concerning the recognition of six types of grasping movements. The systems developed achieved the highest classification accuracies demonstrating the potential of multiple classifier systems with multimodal biosignals for the control of bioprosthetic hand.",
   "Physiological challenges for intracortical electrodes.\nThe clinical use of chronic electrode implants for measurement or stimulation of neuronal activity has increased over the past decade with the advent of deep brain stimulation and the use of brain-computer interfaces. However, despite the wide-spread application of electrode implants, their chronic use is still limited by technical difficulties. Many of the reported issues, ranging from short-circuits to loss of signal due to increased electrical impedance, may be traced back to the reaction of the cortical tissue to the implanted devices: the foreign body response (FBR). This response consists of several phases that ultimately result in neuronal loss and the formation of a dense glial sheath that encapsulates the implant. Empirical evidence suggests that reducing the FBR has a positive effect on the electrical properties of implants, which can potentially expand their clinical use by improving their chronic usability. The primary focus of this work is to review the consequences of the FBR and recent developments that can be considered to control and limit its development. We will discuss how the choice of device material and electrode-architecture influences the tissue reaction, as well as modifications that allow for less stiff implants, increase electrode conductivity, or improve the implant-tissue integration. Several promising biological solutions include the local release of anti-inflammatory compounds to weaken the initial inflammatory phase of the FBR, as well as methods to diminish the negative effects of the glial sheath on neuronal regrowth.",
   "Neuronal Correlates of Cognitive Control during Gaming Revealed by Near-Infrared Spectroscopy.\nIn everyday life we quickly build and maintain associations between stimuli and behavioral responses. This is governed by rules of varying complexity and past studies have identified an underlying fronto-parietal network involved in cognitive control processes. However, there is only limited knowledge about the neuronal activations during more natural settings like game playing. We thus assessed whether near-infrared spectroscopy recordings can reflect different demands on cognitive control during a simple game playing task. Sixteen healthy participants had to catch falling objects by pressing computer keys. These objects either fell randomly (RANDOM task), according to a known stimulus-response mapping applied by players (APPLY task) or according to a stimulus-response mapping that had to be learned (LEARN task). We found an increased change of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin during LEARN covering broad areas over right frontal, central and parietal cortex. Opposed to this, hemoglobin changes were less pronounced for RANDOM and APPLY. Along with the findings that fewer objects were caught during LEARN but stimulus-response mappings were successfully identified, we attribute the higher activations to an increased cognitive load when extracting an unknown mapping. This study therefore demonstrates a neuronal marker of cognitive control during gaming revealed by near-infrared spectroscopy recordings.",
   "Comparison of DFT and lock-in amplifier features and search for optimal electrode positions in SSVEP-based BCI.\nBrain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) have been investigated increasingly in the last years. This type of brain signals resulting from repetitive flicker stimulation has the same fundamental frequency as the stimulation including higher harmonics. This study investigated how the classification accuracy of a 4-class BCI system can be improved by localizing individual electroencephalogram (EEG) recording positions. In the current work, a 4-class SSVEP-based BCI system was set up. Ten subjects participated and EEG was recorded from 21 channels overlying occipital areas. Features were extracted by applying Discrete Fourier transformation and a lock-in analyzer system. A simple one versus the rest classifier was applied to compare methods and localize individual electrode positions. It was shown that the use of three SSVEP-harmonics recorded from individual channels yielded significantly higher classification accuracy compared to one harmonic and to the standard positions O1 and O2. Furthermore, the application of a simple one versus the rest classifier and the use of a lock-in analyzer system lead to a higher classification accuracy (mean+/-S.D., about 74+/-16%) in a 4-class BCI compared to the commonly used Discrete Fourier transformation (DFT, 62+/-14%). By applying a screening procedure, the optimal electrode positions for bipolar derivations can be detected. Furthermore, information about subject's specific 'resonance-like' frequency regions can be obtained by observing higher harmonics of the SSVEPs.",
   "A comparative study: use of a Brain-computer Interface (BCI) device by people with cerebral palsy in interaction with computers.\nThis article presents a comparative study among people with cerebral palsy and healthy controls, of various ages, using a Brain-computer Interface (BCI) device. The research is qualitative in its approach. Researchers worked with Observational Case Studies. People with cerebral palsy and healthy controls were evaluated in Portugal and in Brazil. The study aimed to develop a study for product evaluation in order to perceive whether people with cerebral palsy could interact with the computer and compare whether their performance is similar to that of healthy controls when using the Brain-computer Interface. Ultimately, it was found that there are no significant differences between people with cerebral palsy in the two countries, as well as between populations without cerebral palsy (healthy controls).",
   "Hidden Markov model and support vector machine based decoding of finger movements using electrocorticography.\nSupport vector machines (SVM) have developed into a gold standard for accurate classification in brain-computer interfaces (BCI). The choice of the most appropriate classifier for a particular application depends on several characteristics in addition to decoding accuracy. Here we investigate the implementation of hidden Markov models (HMM) for online BCIs and discuss strategies to improve their performance.",
   "Engineering Artificial Somatosensation Through Cortical Stimulation in Humans.\nSensory feedback is a critical aspect of motor control rehabilitation following paralysis or amputation. Current human studies have demonstrated the ability to deliver some of this sensory information via brain-machine interfaces, although further testing is needed to understand the stimulation parameters effect on sensation. Here, we report a systematic evaluation of somatosensory restoration in humans, using cortical stimulation with subdural mini-electrocorticography (mini-ECoG) grids. Nine epilepsy patients undergoing implantation of cortical electrodes for seizure localization were also implanted with a subdural 64-channel mini-ECoG grid over the hand area of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). We mapped the somatotopic location and size of receptive fields evoked by stimulation of individual channels of the mini-ECoG grid. We determined the effects on perception by varying stimulus parameters of pulse width, current amplitude, and frequency. Finally, a target localization task was used to demonstrate the use of artificial sensation in a behavioral task. We found a replicable somatotopic representation of the hand on the mini-ECoG grid across most subjects during electrical stimulation. The stimulus-evoked sensations were usually of artificial quality, but in some cases were more natural and of a cutaneous or proprioceptive nature. Increases in pulse width, current strength and frequency generally produced similar quality sensations at the same somatotopic location, but with a perception of increased intensity. The subjects produced near perfect performance when using the evoked sensory information in target acquisition tasks. These findings indicate that electrical stimulation of somatosensory cortex through mini-ECoG grids has considerable potential for restoring useful sensation to patients with paralysis and amputation.",
   "Smoothness as a failure mode of Bayesian mixture models in brain-machine interfaces.\nVarious recursive Bayesian filters based on reach state equations (RSE) have been proposed to convert neural signals into reaching movements in brain-machine interfaces. When the target is known, RSE produce exquisitely smooth trajectories relative to the random walk prior in the basic Kalman filter. More realistically, the target is unknown, and gaze analysis or other side information is expected to provide a discrete set of potential targets. In anticipation of this scenario, various groups have implemented RSE-based mixture (hybrid) models, which define a discrete random variable to represent target identity. While principled, this approach sacrifices the smoothness of RSE with known targets. This paper combines empirical spiking data from primary motor cortex and mathematical analysis to explain this loss in performance. We focus on angular velocity as a meaningful and convenient measure of smoothness. Our results demonstrate that angular velocity in the trajectory is approximately proportional to change in target probability. The constant of proportionality equals the difference in heading between parallel filters from the two most probable targets, suggesting a smoothness benefit to more narrowly spaced targets. Simulation confirms that measures to smooth the data likelihood also improve the smoothness of hybrid trajectories, including increased ensemble size and uniformity in preferred directions. We speculate that closed-loop training or neuronal subset selection could be used to shape the user's tuning curves towards this end.",
   "Discriminative channel addition and reduction for filter bank common spatial pattern in motor imagery BCI.\nAn electroencephalography (EEG)-based Motor Imagery Brain-Computer Interface (MI-BCI) requires a long setup time if a large number of channels is used, and EEG from noisy or irrelevant channels may adversely affect the classification performance. To address this issue, this paper proposed 2 approaches to systematically select discriminative channels for EEG-based MI-BCI. The proposed Discriminative Channel Addition (DCA) approach and the Discriminative Channel Reduction (DCR) approach selects subject-specific discriminative channels by iteratively adding or removing channels based on the cross-validation classification accuracies obtained using the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern algorithm. The performances of the proposed approaches were evaluated on the BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a. The results on 2-class and 4-class MI data showed that DCA, which iteratively adds channels, selected 13~14 channels that consistently yielded better cross-validation accuracies on the training data and session-to-session transfer accuracies on the evaluation data compared to the use of a full 22-channel setup. Hence, this results in a reduced channel setup that could improve the classification accuracy of the MI-BCI after removing less discriminative channels.",
   "A new (semantic) reflexive brain-computer interface: in search for a suitable classifier.\nThe goal of the current study is to find a suitable classifier for electroencephalogram (EEG) data derived from a new learning paradigm which aims at communication in paralysis. A reflexive semantic classical (Pavlovian) conditioning paradigm is explored as an alternative to the operant learning paradigms, currently used in most brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Comparable with a lie-detection experiment, subjects are presented with true and false statements. The EEG activity following true and false statements was classified with the aim to separate covert 'yes' from covert 'no' responses. Four classification algorithms are compared for classifying off-line data collected from a group of 14 healthy participants: (i) stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA), (ii) shrinkage linear discriminant analysis (SLDA), (iii) linear support vector machine (LIN-SVM) and (iv) radial basis function kernel support vector machine (RBF-SVM). The results indicate that all classifiers perform at chance level when separating conditioned 'yes' from conditioned 'no' responses. However, single conditioned reactions could be successfully classified on a single-trial basis (single conditioned reaction against a baseline interval). All of the four investigated classification methods achieve comparable performance, however results with RBF-SVM show the highest single-trial classification accuracy of 68.8%. The results suggest that the proposed paradigm may allow affirmative and negative (disapproving negative) communication in a BCI experiment.",
   "Performance of the Emotiv Epoc headset for P300-based applications.\nFor two decades, EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems have been widely studied in research labs. Now, researchers want to consider out-of-the-lab applications and make this technology available to everybody. However, medical-grade EEG recording devices are still much too expensive for end-users, especially disabled people. Therefore, several low-cost alternatives have appeared on the market. The Emotiv Epoc headset is one of them. Although some previous work showed this device could suit the customer's needs in terms of performance, no quantitative classification-based assessments compared to a medical system are available.",
   "Prediction of auditory and visual p300 brain-computer interface aptitude.\nBrain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide a non-muscular communication channel for patients with late-stage motoneuron disease (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)) or otherwise motor impaired people and are also used for motor rehabilitation in chronic stroke. Differences in the ability to use a BCI vary from person to person and from session to session. A reliable predictor of aptitude would allow for the selection of suitable BCI paradigms. For this reason, we investigated whether P300 BCI aptitude could be predicted from a short experiment with a standard auditory oddball.",
   "Low-power circuits for brain-machine interfaces.\nThis paper presents work on ultra-low-power circuits for brain-machine interfaces with applications for paralysis prosthetics, stroke, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, prosthetics for the blind, and experimental neuroscience systems. The circuits include a micropower neural amplifier with adaptive power biasing for use in multi-electrode arrays; an analog linear decoding and learning architecture for data compression; low-power radio-frequency (RF) impedance-modulation circuits for data telemetry that minimize power consumption of implanted systems in the body; a wireless link for efficient power transfer; mixed-signal system integration for efficiency, robustness, and programmability; and circuits for wireless stimulation of neurons with power-conserving sleep modes and awake modes. Experimental results from chips that have stimulated and recorded from neurons in the zebra finch brain and results from RF power-link, RF data-link, electrode-recording and electrode-stimulating systems are presented. Simulations of analog learning circuits that have successfully decoded prerecorded neural signals from a monkey brain are also presented.",
   "Transfer Learning for Brain-Computer Interfaces: A Euclidean Space Data Alignment Approach.\nThis paper targets a major challenge in developing practical electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs): how to cope with individual differences so that better learning performance can be obtained for a new subject, with minimum or even no subject-specific data?",
   "Pseudo-Online BMI Based on EEG to Detect the Appearance of Sudden Obstacles during Walking.\nThe aim of this paper is to describe new methods for detecting the appearance of unexpected obstacles during normal gait from EEG signals, improving the accuracy and reducing the false positive rate obtained in previous studies. This way, an exoskeleton for rehabilitation or assistance of people with motor limitations commanded by a Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) could be stopped in case that an obstacle suddenly appears during walking. The EEG data of nine healthy subjects were collected during their normal gait while an obstacle appearance was simulated by the projection of a laser line in a random pattern. Different approaches were considered for selecting the parameters of the BMI: subsets of electrodes, time windows and classifier probabilities, which were based on a linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The pseudo-online results of the BMI for detecting the appearance of obstacles, with an average percentage of 63.9% of accuracy and 2.6 false positives per minute, showed a significant improvement over previous studies.",
   "Progress towards biocompatible intracortical microelectrodes for neural interfacing applications.\nTo ensure long-term consistent neural recordings, next-generation intracortical microelectrodes are being developed with an increased emphasis on reducing the neuro-inflammatory response. The increased emphasis stems from the improved understanding of the multifaceted role that inflammation may play in disrupting both biologic and abiologic components of the overall neural interface circuit. To combat neuro-inflammation and improve recording quality, the field is actively progressing from traditional inorganic materials towards approaches that either minimizes the microelectrode footprint or that incorporate compliant materials, bioactive molecules, conducting polymers or nanomaterials. However, the immune-privileged cortical tissue introduces an added complexity compared to other biomedical applications that remains to be fully understood. This review provides a comprehensive reflection on the current understanding of the key failure modes that may impact intracortical microelectrode performance. In addition, a detailed overview of the current status of various materials-based approaches that have gained interest for neural interfacing applications is presented, and key challenges that remain to be overcome are discussed. Finally, we present our vision on the future directions of materials-based treatments to improve intracortical microelectrodes for neural interfacing.",
   "Brain-Computer Interface for Clinical Purposes: Cognitive Assessment and Rehabilitation.\nAlongside the best-known applications of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology for restoring communication abilities and controlling external devices, we present the state of the art of BCI use for cognitive assessment and training purposes. We first describe some preliminary attempts to develop verbal-motor free BCI-based tests for evaluating specific or multiple cognitive domains in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, disorders of consciousness, and other neurological diseases. Then we present the more heterogeneous and advanced field of BCI-based cognitive training, which has its roots in the context of neurofeedback therapy and addresses patients with neurological developmental disorders (autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder), stroke patients, and elderly subjects. We discuss some advantages of BCI for both assessment and training purposes, the former concerning the possibility of longitudinally and reliably evaluating cognitive functions in patients with severe motor disabilities, the latter regarding the possibility of enhancing patients' motivation and engagement for improving neural plasticity. Finally, we discuss some present and future challenges in the BCI use for the described purposes.",

   "Does arousal interfere with operant conditioning of spike-wave discharges in genetic epileptic rats?\nOne of the ways in which brain computer interfaces can be used is neurofeedback (NF). Subjects use their brain activation to control an external device, and with this technique it is also possible to learn to control aspects of the brain activity by operant conditioning. Beneficial effects of NF training on seizure occurrence have been described in epileptic patients. Little research has been done about differentiating NF effectiveness by type of epilepsy, particularly, whether idiopathic generalized seizures are susceptible to NF. In this experiment, seizures that manifest themselves as spike-wave discharges (SWDs) in the EEG were reinforced during 10 sessions in 6 rats of the WAG/Rij strain, an animal model for absence epilepsy. EEG's were recorded before and after the training sessions. Reinforcing SWDs let to decreased SWD occurrences during training; however, the changes during training were not persistent in the post-training sessions. Because behavioural states are known to have an influence on the occurrence of SWDs, it is proposed that the reinforcement situation increased arousal which resulted in fewer SWDs. Additional tests supported this hypothesis. The outcomes have implications for the possibility to train SWDs with operant learning techniques.",
   "Enhancing Detection of SSVEPs with Intermodulation Frequencies Using Individual Calibration Data.\nSteady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have potential to realize high-speed communication between human brain and external devices. Recently, we proposed an intermodulation frequency-based stimulation approach to increase the number of visual stimuli that can be presented on a computer monitor. Although our recent studies have demonstrated that this approach can encode more visual stimuli by only one flickering frequency, the performance of the intermodulation frequency-based SSVEP BCI remains poor and needs further improvement. This study aims to incorporate filter bank analysis and individual SSVEP calibration data into canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to improve the detection of SSVEPs with intermodulation frequencies. Results on classification accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR) suggest that the employment of individual calibration data can significantly improve the performance of the intermodulation frequency-based SSVEP BCI.",
   "Plasticity of premotor cortico-muscular coherence in severely impaired stroke patients with hand paralysis.\nMotor recovery in severely impaired stroke patients is often very limited. To refine therapeutic interventions for regaining motor control in this patient group, the functionally relevant mechanisms of neuronal plasticity need to be detected. Cortico-muscular coherence (CMC) may provide physiological and topographic insights to achieve this goal. Synchronizing limb movements to motor-related brain activation is hypothesized to reestablish cortico-motor control indexed by CMC. In the present study, right-handed, chronic stroke patients with right-hemispheric lesions and left hand paralysis participated in a four-week training for their left upper extremity. A brain-robot interface turned event-related beta-band desynchronization of the lesioned sensorimotor cortex during kinesthetic motor-imagery into the opening of the paralyzed hand by a robotic orthosis. Simultaneous MEG/EMG recordings and individual models from MRIs were used for CMC detection and source reconstruction of cortico-muscular connectivity to the affected finger extensors before and after the training program. The upper extremity-FMA of the patients improved significantly from 16.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.79 to 19.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.91 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0015). All patients showed significantly increased CMC in the beta frequency-band, with a distributed, bi-hemispheric pattern and considerable inter-individual variability. The location of CMC changes was not correlated to the severity of the motor impairment, the motor improvement or the lesion volume. Group analysis of the cortical overlap revealed a common feature in all patients following the intervention: a significantly increased level of ipsilesional premotor CMC that extended from the superior to the middle and inferior frontal gyrus, along with a confined area of increased CMC in the contralesional premotor cortex. In conclusion, functionally relevant modulations of CMC can be detected in patients with long-term, severe motor deficits after a brain-robot assisted rehabilitation training. Premotor beta-band CMC may serve as a biomarker and therapeutic target for novel treatment approaches in this patient group.",
   "Effects of Brain-Computer Interface-controlled Functional Electrical Stimulation Training on Shoulder Subluxation for Patients with Stroke: A Randomized Controlled Trial.\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of brain-computer interface (BCI)-controlled functional electrical stimulation (FES) training on shoulder subluxation of patients with stroke. Twenty subjects were randomly divided into two groups: the BCI-FES group (n\u2009=\u200910) and the FES group (n\u2009=\u200910). Patients in the BCI-FES group were administered conventional therapy with the BCI-FES on the shoulder subluxation area of the paretic upper extremity, five times per week during 6\u2009weeks, while the FES group received conventional therapy with FES only. All patients were assessed for shoulder subluxation (vertical distance, VD; horizontal distance, HD), pain (visual analogue scale, VAS) and the Manual Function Test (MFT) at the time of recruitment to the study and after 6\u2009weeks of the intervention. The BCI-FES group demonstrated significant improvements in VD, HD, VAS and MFT after the intervention period, while the FES group demonstrated significant improvements in HD, VAS and MFT. There were also significant differences in the VD and two items (shoulder flexion and abduction) of the MFT between the two groups. The results of this study suggest that BCI-FES training may be effective in improving shoulder subluxation of patients with stroke by facilitating motor recovery.",
   "Algorithmic clustering based on string compression to extract P300 structure in EEG signals.\nP300 is an Event Related Potential control signal widely used in Brain Computer Interfaces. Using the oddball paradigm, a P300 speller allows a human to spell letters through P300 events produced by his/her brain. One of the most common issues in the detection of this event is that its structure may differ between different subjects and over time for a specific subject. The main purpose of this work is to deal with this inherent variability and identify the main structure of P300 using algorithmic clustering based on string compression.",
   "Brain-computer interface (BCI) evaluation in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\nBrain-computer interfaces (BCIs) might restore communication to people severely disabled by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or other disorders. We sought to: 1) define a protocol for determining whether a person with ALS can use a visual P300-based BCI; 2) determine what proportion of this population can use the BCI; and 3) identify factors affecting BCI performance. Twenty-five individuals with ALS completed an evaluation protocol using a standard 6 \u00d7 6 matrix and parameters selected by stepwise linear discrimination. With an 8-channel EEG montage, the subjects fell into two groups in BCI accuracy (chance accuracy 3%). Seventeen averaged 92 (\u00b1 3)% (range 71-100%), which is adequate for communication (G70 group). Eight averaged 12 (\u00b1 6)% (range 0-36%), inadequate for communication (L40 subject group). Performance did not correlate with disability: 11/17 (65%) of G70 subjects were severely disabled (i.e. ALSFRS-R < 5). All L40 subjects had visual impairments (e.g. nystagmus, diplopia, ptosis). P300 was larger and more anterior in G70 subjects. A 16-channel montage did not significantly improve accuracy. In conclusion, most people severely disabled by ALS could use a visual P300-based BCI for communication. In those who could not, visual impairment was the principal obstacle. For these individuals, auditory P300-based BCIs might be effective.",
   "Toward optimal feature and time segment selection by divergence method for EEG signals classification.\nFeature selection plays an important role in the field of EEG signals based motor imagery pattern classification. It is a process that aims to select an optimal feature subset from the original set. Two significant advantages involved are: lowering the computational burden so as to speed up the learning procedure and removing redundant and irrelevant features so as to improve the classification performance. Therefore, feature selection is widely employed in the classification of EEG signals in practical brain-computer interface systems. In this paper, we present a novel statistical model to select the optimal feature subset based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure, and automatically select the optimal subject-specific time segment. The proposed method comprises four successive stages: a broad frequency band filtering and common spatial pattern enhancement as preprocessing, features extraction by autoregressive model and log-variance, the Kullback-Leibler divergence based optimal feature and time segment selection and linear discriminate analysis classification. More importantly, this paper provides a potential framework for combining other feature extraction models and classification algorithms with the proposed method for EEG signals classification. Experiments on single-trial EEG signals from two public competition datasets not only demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in selecting discriminative features and time segment, but also show that the proposed method yields relatively better classification results in comparison with other competitive methods.",
   "Active SAmpling Protocol (ASAP) to Optimize Individual Neurocognitive Hypothesis Testing: A BCI-Inspired Dynamic Experimental Design.\nThe relatively young field of Brain-Computer Interfaces has promoted the use of electrophysiology and neuroimaging in real-time. In the meantime, cognitive neuroscience studies, which make extensive use of functional exploration techniques, have evolved toward model-based experiments and fine hypothesis testing protocols. Although these two developments are mostly unrelated, we argue that, brought together, they may trigger an important shift in the way experimental paradigms are being designed, which should prove fruitful to both endeavors. This change simply consists in using real-time neuroimaging in order to optimize advanced neurocognitive hypothesis testing. We refer to this new approach as the instantiation of an Active SAmpling Protocol (ASAP). As opposed to classical (static) experimental protocols, ASAP implements online model comparison, enabling the optimization of design parameters (e.g., stimuli) during the course of data acquisition. This follows the well-known principle of sequential hypothesis testing. What is radically new, however, is our ability to perform online processing of the huge amount of complex data that brain imaging techniques provide. This is all the more relevant at a time when physiological and psychological processes are beginning to be approached using more realistic, generative models which may be difficult to tease apart empirically. Based upon Bayesian inference, ASAP proposes a generic and principled way to optimize experimental design adaptively. In this perspective paper, we summarize the main steps in ASAP. Using synthetic data we illustrate its superiority in selecting the right perceptual model compared to a classical design. Finally, we briefly discuss its future potential for basic and clinical neuroscience as well as some remaining challenges.",
   "A versatile robotic platform for the design of natural, three-dimensional reaching and grasping tasks in monkeys.\nTranslational studies on motor control and neurological disorders require detailed monitoring of sensorimotor components of natural limb movements in relevant animal models. However, available experimental tools do not provide a sufficiently rich repertoire of behavioral signals. Here, we developed a robotic platform that enables the monitoring of kinematics, interaction forces, and neurophysiological signals during user-defined upper limb tasks for monkeys.",
   "Manipulation of Rat Movement via Nigrostriatal Stimulation Controlled by Human Visually Evoked Potentials.\nHere, we report that the development of a brain-to-brain interface (BBI) system that enables a human user to manipulate rat movement without any previous training. In our model, the remotely-guided rats (known as ratbots) successfully navigated a T-maze via contralateral turning behaviour induced by electrical stimulation of the nigrostriatal (NS) pathway by a brain- computer interface (BCI) based on the human controller's steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs). The system allowed human participants to manipulate rat movement with an average success rate of 82.2% and at an average rat speed of approximately 1.9\u2009m/min. The ratbots had no directional preference, showing average success rates of 81.1% and 83.3% for the left- and right-turning task, respectively. This is the first study to demonstrate the use of NS stimulation for developing a highly stable ratbot that does not require previous training, and is the first instance of a training-free BBI for rat navigation. The results of this study will facilitate the development of borderless communication between human and untrained animals, which could not only improve the understanding of animals in humans, but also allow untrained animals to more effectively provide humans with information obtained with their superior perception.",
   "Decoding hand trajectories from micro-electrocorticography in human patients.\nA Kalman filter was used to decode hand trajectories from micro-electrocorticography recorded over motor cortex in human patients. In two cases, signals were recorded during stereotyped tasks, and the trajectories were decoded offline, with maximum correlation coefficients between actual and predicted trajectories of 0.51 (x-direction position) and 0.54 (y-direction position). In a third setting, a human patient with full neural control of a computer cursor acquired onscreen targets within 6.24 sec on average, with no algorithmic constraints on the output trajectory. These practical results illustrate the potential utility of signals recorded at the cortical surface with high spatial resolution, demonstrating that surface potentials contain relevant and sufficient information to drive sophisticated brain-computer interface systems.",
   "The hybrid BCI system for movement control by combining motor imagery and moving onset visual evoked potential.\nMovement control is an important application for EEG-BCI (EEG-based brain-computer interface) systems. A single-modality BCI cannot provide an efficient and natural control strategy, but a hybrid BCI system that combines two or more different tasks can effectively overcome the drawbacks encountered in single-modality BCI control.",
   "Highly Conductive, Stretchable, and Cell-Adhesive Hydrogel by Nanoclay Doping.\nElectrically conductive materials that mimic physical and biological properties of tissues are urgently required for seamless brain-machine interfaces. Here, a multinetwork hydrogel combining electrical conductivity of 26 S m-1 , stretchability of 800%, and tissue-like elastic modulus of 15 kPa with mimicry of the extracellular matrix is reported. Engineering this unique set of properties is enabled by a novel in-scaffold polymerization approach. Colloidal hydrogels of the nanoclay Laponite are employed as supports for the assembly of secondary polymer networks. Laponite dramatically increases the conductivity of in-scaffold polymerized poly(ethylene-3,4-diethoxy thiophene) in the absence of other dopants, while preserving excellent stretchability. The scaffold is coated with a layer containing adhesive peptide and polysaccharide dextran sulfate supporting the attachment, proliferation, and neuronal differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells directly on the surface of conductive hydrogels. Due to its compatibility with simple extrusion printing, this material promises to enable tissue-mimetic neurostimulating electrodes.",
   "Self-Paced Operation of a Wheelchair Based on a Hybrid Brain-Computer Interface Combining Motor Imagery and P300 Potential.\nThis paper presents a hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) that combines motor imagery (MI) and P300 potential for the asynchronous operation of a brain-controlled wheelchair whose design is based on a Mecanum wheel. This paradigm is completely user-centric. By sequentially performing MI tasks or paying attention to P300 flashing, the user can use eleven functions to control the wheelchair: move forward/backward, move left/right, move left45/right45, accelerate/decelerate, turn left/right, and stop. The practicality and effectiveness of the proposed approach were validated in eight subjects, all of whom achieved good performance. The preliminary results indicated that the proposed hybrid BCI system with different mental strategies operating sequentially is feasible and has potential applications for practical self-paced control.",
   "Side-channel attacks against the human brain: the PIN code case study (extended version).\nWe revisit the side-channel attacks with brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) first put forward by Martinovic et al. at the USENIX 2012 Security Symposium. For this purpose, we propose a comprehensive investigation of concrete adversaries trying to extract a PIN code from electroencephalogram signals. Overall, our results confirm the possibility of partial PIN recovery with high probability of success in a more quantified manner and at the same time put forward the challenges of full/systematic PIN recovery. They also highlight that the attack complexities can significantly vary in function of the adversarial capabilities (e.g., supervised/profiled vs. unsupervised/non-profiled), hence leading to an interesting trade-off between their efficiency and practical relevance. We then show that similar attack techniques can be used to threat the privacy of BCI users. We finally use our experiments to discuss the impact of such attacks for the security and privacy of BCI applications at large, and the important emerging societal challenges they raise.",
   "Integrating EEG and MEG Signals to Improve Motor Imagery Classification in Brain-Computer Interface.\nWe adopted a fusion approach that combines features from simultaneously recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) signals to improve classification performances in motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). We applied our approach to a group of 15 healthy subjects and found a significant classification performance enhancement as compared to standard single-modality approaches in the alpha and beta bands. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the advantage of considering multimodal approaches as complementary tools for improving the impact of noninvasive BCIs.",
   "Ascertaining neuron importance by information theoretical analysis in motor Brain-Machine Interfaces.\nPoint process modeling of neural spike recordings has the potential to capture with high specificity the information contained in spike time occurrence. In Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) the neural tuning characteristic assessed from neural spike recordings can distinguish neuron importance in terms of its modulation with the movement task. Consequently, it improves generalization and reduces significantly computation in previous decoding algorithms, where models reconstruct the kinematics from recorded activities of hundreds of neurons. We propose to apply information theoretical analysis based on an instantaneous tuning model to extract the important neuron subsets for point process decoding on BMI. The cortical distribution of extracted neuron subsets is analyzed and the statistical decoding performance using subset selection is studied with respect to different number of neurons and compared to the one by the full neuron ensemble. With much less computation, the extracted importance neurons provide comparable kinematic reconstructions compared to the full neuron ensemble. The performance of the extracted subset is compared to the random selected subset with same number of neurons to further validate the effectiveness of the subset-extraction approach.",
   "The portable P300 dialing system based on tablet and Emotiv Epoc headset.\nA Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a novel communication system that translates brain signals into a control signal. Now with the appearance of the commercial EEG headsets and mobile smart platforms (tablet, smartphone), it is possible to develop the mobile BCI system, which can greatly improve the life quality of patients suffering from motor disease, such as amyotrophic lateral scleroses (ALS), multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy and head trauma. This study adopted a 14-channel Emotiv EPOC headset and Microsoft surface pro 3 to realize a dialing system, which was represented by 4\u00d73 matrices of alphanumeric characters. The performance of the online portable dialing system based on P300 is satisfying. The average classification accuracy reaches 88.75\u00b110.57% in lab and 73.75\u00b116.94% in metro, while the information transfer rate (ITR) reaches 7.17\u00b11.80 and 5.05\u00b12.17 bits/min respectively. This means the commercial EEG headset and tablet has good prospect in developing real time BCI system in realistic environments.",

   "Sensors and decoding for intracortical brain computer interfaces.\nIntracortical brain computer interfaces (iBCIs) are being developed to enable people to drive an output device, such as a computer cursor, directly from their neural activity. One goal of the technology is to help people with severe paralysis or limb loss. Key elements of an iBCI are the implanted sensor that records the neural signals and the software that decodes the user's intended movement from those signals. Here, we focus on recent advances in these two areas, placing special attention on contributions that are or may soon be adopted by the iBCI research community. We discuss how these innovations increase the technology's capability, accuracy, and longevity, all important steps that are expanding the range of possible future clinical applications.",
   "Sparse Bayesian Learning for Obtaining Sparsity of EEG Frequency Bands Based Feature Vectors in Motor Imagery Classification.\nEffective common spatial pattern (CSP) feature extraction for motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings usually depends on the filter band selection to a large extent. Subband optimization has been suggested to enhance classification accuracy of MI. Accordingly, this study introduces a new method that implements sparse Bayesian learning of frequency bands (named SBLFB) from EEG for MI classification. CSP features are extracted on a set of signals that are generated by a filter bank with multiple overlapping subbands from raw EEG data. Sparse Bayesian learning is then exploited to implement selection of significant features with a linear discriminant criterion for classification. The effectiveness of SBLFB is demonstrated on the BCI Competition IV IIb dataset, in comparison with several other competing methods. Experimental results indicate that the SBLFB method is promising for development of an effective classifier to improve MI classification.",
   "Relevant Feature Selection from a Combination of Spectral-Temporal and Spatial Features for Classification of Motor Imagery EEG.\nThis paper presents a novel algorithm (CVSTSCSP) for determining discriminative features from an optimal combination of temporal, spectral and spatial information for motor imagery brain computer interfaces. The proposed method involves four phases. In the first phase, EEG signal is segmented into overlapping time segments and bandpass filtered through frequency filter bank of variable size subbands. In the next phase, features are extracted from the segmented and filtered data using stationary common spatial pattern technique (SCSP) that can handle the non- stationarity and artifacts of EEG signal. The univariate feature selection method is used to obtain a relevant subset of features in the third phase. In the final phase, the classifier is used to build adecision model. In this paper, four univariate feature selection methods such as Euclidean distance, correlation, mutual information and Fisher discriminant ratio and two well-known classifiers (LDA and SVM) are investigated. The proposed method has been validated using the publicly available BCI competition IV dataset Ia and BCI Competition III dataset IVa. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing methods in terms of classification error. A reduction of 76.98%, 75.65%, 73.90% and 72.21% in classification error over both datasets and both classifiers can be observed using the proposed CVSTSCSP method in comparison to CSP, SBCSP, FBCSP and CVSCSP respectively.",
   "Combining Cryptography with EEG Biometrics.\nCryptographic frameworks depend on key sharing for ensuring security of data. While the keys in cryptographic frameworks must be correctly reproducible and not unequivocally connected to the identity of a user, in biometric frameworks this is different. Joining cryptography techniques with biometrics can solve these issues. We present a biometric authentication method based on the discrete logarithm problem and Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes, perform its security analysis, and demonstrate its security characteristics. We evaluate a biometric cryptosystem using our own dataset of electroencephalography (EEG) data collected from 42 subjects. The experimental results show that the described biometric user authentication system is effective, achieving an Equal Error Rate (ERR) of 0.024.",
   "Development of Single-Channel Hybrid BCI System Using Motor Imagery and SSVEP.\nNumerous EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems that are being developed focus on novel feature extraction algorithms, classification methods and combining existing approaches to create hybrid BCIs. Several recent studies demonstrated various advantages of hybrid BCI systems in terms of an improved accuracy or number of commands available for the user. But still, BCI systems are far from realization for daily use. Having high performance with less number of channels is one of the challenging issues that persists, especially with hybrid BCI systems, where multiple channels are necessary to record information from two or more EEG signal components. Therefore, this work proposes a single-channel (C3 or C4) hybrid BCI system that combines motor imagery (MI) and steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) approaches. This study demonstrates that besides MI features, SSVEP features can also be captured from C3 or C4 channel. The results show that due to rich feature information (MI and SSVEP) at these channels, the proposed hybrid BCI system outperforms both MI- and SSVEP-based systems having an average classification accuracy of 85.6\u2009\u00b1\u20097.7% in a two-class task.",
   "Brain-machine interface control of a manipulator using small-world neural network and shared control strategy.\nThe improvement of the resolution of brain signal and the ability to control external device has been the most important goal in BMI research field. This paper describes a non-invasive brain-actuated manipulator experiment, which defined a paradigm for the motion control of a serial manipulator based on motor imagery and shared control. The techniques of component selection, spatial filtering and classification of motor imagery were involved. Small-world neural network (SWNN) was used to classify five brain states. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed classifier, we replace the SWNN classifier by a radial basis function (RBF) networks neural network, a standard multi-layered feed-forward backpropagation network (SMN) and a multi-SVM classifier, with the same features for the classification. The results also indicate that the proposed classifier achieves a 3.83% improvement over the best results of other classifiers. We proposed a shared control method consisting of two control patterns to expand the control of BMI from the software angle. The job of path building for reaching the 'end' point was designated as an assessment task. We recorded all paths contributed by subjects and picked up relevant parameters as evaluation coefficients. With the assistance of two control patterns and series of machine learning algorithms, the proposed BMI originally achieved the motion control of a manipulator in the whole workspace. According to experimental results, we confirmed the feasibility of the proposed BMI method for 3D motion control of a manipulator using EEG during motor imagery.",
   "Potential for unreliable interpretation of EEG recorded with microelectrodes.\nRecent studies in epilepsy, cognition, and brain machine interfaces have shown the utility of recording intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) with greater spatial resolution. Many of these studies utilize microelectrodes connected to specialized amplifiers that are optimized for such recordings. We recently measured the impedances of several commercial microelectrodes and demonstrated that they will distort iEEG signals if connected to clinical EEG amplifiers commonly used in most centers. In this study we demonstrate the clinical implications of this effect and identify some of the potential difficulties in using microelectrodes.",
   "EEG classification for motor imagery and resting state in BCI applications using multi-class Adaboost extreme learning machine.\nBrain-computer interface (BCI) systems provide an alternative communication and control approach for people with limited motor function. Therefore, the feature extraction and classification approach should differentiate the relative unusual state of motion intention from a common resting state. In this paper, we sought a novel approach for multi-class classification in BCI applications. We collected electroencephalographic (EEG) signals registered by electrodes placed over the scalp during left hand motor imagery, right hand motor imagery, and resting state for ten healthy human subjects. We proposed using the Kolmogorov complexity (Kc) for feature extraction and a multi-class Adaboost classifier with extreme learning machine as base classifier for classification, in order to classify the three-class EEG samples. An average classification accuracy of 79.5% was obtained for ten subjects, which greatly outperformed commonly used approaches. Thus, it is concluded that the proposed method could improve the performance for classification of motor imagery tasks for multi-class samples. It could be applied in further studies to generate the control commands to initiate the movement of a robotic exoskeleton or orthosis, which finally facilitates the rehabilitation of disabled people.",
   "Baseplate for two-stage cranial mounting of BMI connectors.\nIntracortical electrode arrays provide the best spatial and temporal resolution signals for brain-machine interfaces. Wireless technologies are being developed to handle this information capacity, but currently the only means to deliver neural information from the implant to a signal processing unit is by a physical connection starting at a skull-mounted connector. The failure rate of the attachment of these connectors is significant. In this study we report an improvement to the traditional connectors.",
   "The Potential for a Speech Brain-Computer Interface Using Chronic Electrocorticography.\nA brain-computer interface (BCI) is a technology that uses neural features to restore or augment the capabilities of its user. A BCI for speech would enable communication in real time via neural correlates of attempted or imagined speech. Such a technology would potentially restore communication and improve quality of life for locked-in patients and other patients with severe communication disorders. There have been many recent developments in neural decoders, neural feature extraction, and brain recording modalities facilitating BCI for the control of prosthetics and in automatic speech recognition (ASR). Indeed, ASR and related fields have developed significantly over the past years, and many lend many insights into the requirements, goals, and strategies for speech BCI. Neural speech decoding is a comparatively new field but has shown much promise with recent studies demonstrating semantic, auditory, and articulatory decoding using electrocorticography (ECoG) and other neural recording modalities. Because the neural representations for speech and language are widely distributed over cortical regions spanning the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, the mesoscopic scale of population activity captured by ECoG surface electrode arrays may have distinct advantages for speech BCI, in contrast to the advantages of microelectrode arrays for upper-limb BCI. Nevertheless, there remain many challenges for the translation of speech BCIs to clinical populations. This review discusses and outlines the current state-of-the-art for speech BCI and explores what a speech BCI using chronic ECoG might entail.",
   "Real-time particle filtering and smoothing algorithms for detecting abrupt changes in neural ensemble spike activity.\nSequential change-point detection from time series data is a common problem in many neuroscience applications, such as seizure detection, anomaly detection, and pain detection. In our previous work (Chen Z, Zhang Q, Tong AP, Manders TR, Wang J. J Neural Eng 14: 036023, 2017), we developed a latent state-space model, known as the Poisson linear dynamical system, for detecting abrupt changes in neuronal ensemble spike activity. In online brain-machine interface (BMI) applications, a recursive filtering algorithm is used to track the changes in the latent variable. However, previous methods have been restricted to Gaussian dynamical noise and have used Gaussian approximation for the Poisson likelihood. To improve the detection speed, we introduce non-Gaussian dynamical noise for modeling a stochastic jump process in the latent state space. To efficiently estimate the state posterior that accommodates non-Gaussian noise and non-Gaussian likelihood, we propose particle filtering and smoothing algorithms for the change-point detection problem. To speed up the computation, we implement the proposed particle filtering algorithms using advanced graphics processing unit computing technology. We validate our algorithms, using both computer simulations and experimental data for acute pain detection. Finally, we discuss several important practical issues in the context of real-time closed-loop BMI applications. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Sequential change-point detection is an important problem in closed-loop neuroscience experiments. This study proposes novel sequential Monte Carlo methods to quickly detect the onset and offset of a stochastic jump process that drives the population spike activity. This new approach is robust with respect to spike sorting noise and varying levels of signal-to-noise ratio. The GPU implementation of the computational algorithm allows for parallel processing in real time.",
   "Bridging the gap between motor imagery and motor execution with a brain-robot interface.\nAccording to electrophysiological studies motor imagery and motor execution are associated with perturbations of brain oscillations over spatially similar cortical areas. By contrast, neuroimaging and lesion studies suggest that at least partially distinct cortical networks are involved in motor imagery and execution. We sought to further disentangle this relationship by studying the role of brain-robot interfaces in the context of motor imagery and motor execution networks. Twenty right-handed subjects performed several behavioral tasks as indicators for imagery and execution of movements of the left hand, i.e. kinesthetic imagery, visual imagery, visuomotor integration and tonic contraction. In addition, subjects performed motor imagery supported by haptic/proprioceptive feedback from a brain-robot-interface. Principal component analysis was applied to assess the relationship of these indicators. The respective cortical resting state networks in the \u03b1-range were investigated by electroencephalography using the phase slope index. We detected two distinct abilities and cortical networks underlying motor control: a motor imagery network connecting the left parietal and motor areas with the right prefrontal cortex and a motor execution network characterized by transmission from the left to right motor areas. We found that a brain-robot-interface might offer a way to bridge the gap between these networks, opening thereby a backdoor to the motor execution system. This knowledge might promote patient screening and may lead to novel treatment strategies, e.g. for the rehabilitation of hemiparesis after stroke.",
   "A Noninvasive Brain-Computer Interface for Real-Time Speech Synthesis: The Importance of Multimodal Feedback.\nWe conducted a study of a motor imagery brain-computer interface (BCI) using electroencephalography to continuously control a formant frequency speech synthesizer with instantaneous auditory and visual feedback. Over a three-session training period, sixteen participants learned to control the BCI for production of three vowel sounds (/ textipa i/ [heed], / textipa A/ [hot], and / textipa u/ [who'd]) and were split into three groups: those receiving unimodal auditory feedback of synthesized speech, those receiving unimodal visual feedback of formant frequencies, and those receiving multimodal, audio-visual (AV) feedback. Audio feedback was provided by a formant frequency artificial speech synthesizer, and visual feedback was given as a 2-D cursor on a graphical representation of the plane defined by the first two formant frequencies. We found that combined AV feedback led to the greatest performance in terms of percent accuracy, distance to target, and movement time to target compared with either unimodal feedback of auditory or visual information. These results indicate that performance is enhanced when multimodal feedback is meaningful for the BCI task goals, rather than as a generic biofeedback signal of BCI progress.",
   "\"I think therefore I am\": new prospects for neural prostheses.\nThree categories of neuro-prosthetics are being developed and used in increasing frequency to ameliorate neurologic disability.

The following is a brief commentary on brain machine interface.",
   "Optimizing the Detection of Wakeful and Sleep-Like States for Future Electrocorticographic Brain Computer Interface Applications.\nPrevious studies suggest stable and robust control of a brain-computer interface (BCI) can be achieved using electrocorticography (ECoG). Translation of this technology from the laboratory to the real world requires additional methods that allow users operate their ECoG-based BCI autonomously. In such an environment, users must be able to perform all tasks currently performed by the experimenter, including manually switching the BCI system on/off. Although a simple task, it can be challenging for target users (e.g., individuals with tetraplegia) due to severe motor disability. In this study, we present an automated and practical strategy to switch a BCI system on or off based on the cognitive state of the user. Using a logistic regression, we built probabilistic models that utilized sub-dural ECoG signals from humans to estimate in pseudo real-time whether a person is awake or in a sleep-like state, and subsequently, whether to turn a BCI system on or off. Furthermore, we constrained these models to identify the optimal anatomical and spectral parameters for delineating states. Other methods exist to differentiate wake and sleep states using ECoG, but none account for practical requirements of BCI application, such as minimizing the size of an ECoG implant and predicting states in real time. Our results demonstrate that, across 4 individuals, wakeful and sleep-like states can be classified with over 80% accuracy (up to 92%) in pseudo real-time using high gamma (70-110 Hz) band limited power from only 5 electrodes (platinum discs with a diameter of 2.3 mm) located above the precentral and posterior superior temporal gyrus.",
   "Factors that affect error potentials during a grasping task: toward a hybrid natural movement decoding BCI.\nIn this manuscript, we consider factors that may affect the design of a hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI). We combine neural correlates of natural movements and interaction error-related potentials (ErrP) to perform a 3D reaching task, focusing on the impact that such factors have on the evoked ErrP signatures and in their classification.",
   "Overcoming Long-Term Variability in Local Field Potentials Using an Adaptive Decoder.\nLong-term variability remains one of the major hurdles in using intracortical recordings like local field potentials for brain computer interfaces (BCI). Practical neural decoders need to overcome time instability of neural signals to estimate subject behavior accurately and faithfully over the long term. This paper presents a novel decoder that 1) characterizes each behavioral task (i.e., different movement directions under different force conditions) with multiple neural patterns and 2) adapts to the long-term variations in neural features by identifying the stable neural patterns. This adaptation can be performed in both an unsupervised and a semisupervised learning framework requiring minimal feedback from the user. To achieve generalization over time, the proposed decoder uses redundant sparse regression models that adapt to day-to-day variations in neural patterns. While this update requires no explicit feedback from the BCI user, any feedback (explicit or derived) to the BCI improves its performance. With this adaptive decoder, we investigated the effects of long-term neural modulation especially when subjects encountered new external forces against movement. The proposed decoder predicted eight hand-movement directions with an accuracy of 95% over two weeks (when there was no external forces); and 85% in later acquisition sessions spanning up to 42 days (when the monkeys countered external field forces). Since the decoder can operate with or without manual intervention, it could alleviate user frustration associated with BCI.",
   "BrainNet: A Multi-Person Brain-to-Brain Interface for Direct Collaboration Between Brains.\nWe present BrainNet which, to our knowledge, is the first multi-person\u00a0non-invasive direct brain-to-brain interface for collaborative problem solving. The interface combines electroencephalography (EEG) to record brain signals and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to deliver information noninvasively to the brain. The interface allows three human subjects to collaborate and solve a task using direct brain-to-brain communication. Two of the three subjects are designated as \"Senders\" whose brain signals are decoded using real-time EEG data analysis. The decoding process extracts each Sender's decision about whether to rotate a block in a Tetris-like game before it is dropped to fill a line. The Senders' decisions are transmitted via the Internet to the brain of a third subject, the \"Receiver,\" who cannot see the game screen. The Senders' decisions are delivered to the Receiver's brain via magnetic stimulation of the occipital cortex. The Receiver integrates the information received from the two Senders and uses an EEG interface to make a decision about either turning the block or keeping it in the same orientation. A second round of the game provides an additional chance for the Senders to evaluate the Receiver's decision and send feedback to the Receiver's brain, and for the Receiver to rectify a possible incorrect decision made in the first round. We evaluated the performance of BrainNet in terms of (1) Group-level performance during the game, (2) True/False positive rates of subjects' decisions, and (3) Mutual information between subjects. Five groups, each with three human subjects, successfully used BrainNet to perform the collaborative\u00a0task, with an average accuracy of 81.25%. Furthermore, by varying the information reliability of the Senders by artificially injecting noise into one Sender's signal, we investigated how the Receiver learns to integrate noisy signals in order to make a correct decision. We found that like conventional social networks, BrainNet allows Receivers to learn to trust the Sender who is more reliable, in this case, based solely on the information transmitted directly to their brains. Our results point the way to future brain-to-brain interfaces that enable cooperative problem solving by humans using a \"social network\" of connected brains.",
   "Thought-Controlled Nanoscale Robots in a Living Host.\nWe report a new type of brain-machine interface enabling a human operator to control nanometer-size robots inside a living animal by brain activity. Recorded EEG patterns are recognized online by an algorithm, which in turn controls the state of an electromagnetic field. The field induces the local heating of billions of mechanically-actuating DNA origami robots tethered to metal nanoparticles, leading to their reversible activation and subsequent exposure of a bioactive payload. As a proof of principle we demonstrate activation of DNA robots to cause a cellular effect inside the insect Blaberus discoidalis, by a cognitively straining task. This technology enables the online switching of a bioactive molecule on and off in response to a subject's cognitive state, with potential implications to therapeutic control in disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, and attention deficits, which are among the most challenging conditions to diagnose and treat.",
   "Single Versus Multiple Events Error Potential Detection in a BCI-Controlled Car Game With Continuous and Discrete Feedback.\nThis work aimed to find and evaluate a new method for detecting errors in continuous brain-computer interface (BCI) applications.

   "Developing stimulus presentation on mobile devices for a truly portable SSVEP-based BCI.\nThis study integrates visual stimulus presentation and near real-time data processing on a mobile device (e.g. a Tablet or a cell-phone) to implement a steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interface (BCI). The goal of this study is to increase the practicability, portability and ubiquity of an SSVEP-based BCI for daily use. The accuracy of flickering frequencies on the mobile SSVEP BCI system was tested against that on a laptop/desktop used in our previous studies. This study then analyzed the power spectrum density of the electroencephalogram signals elicited by the visual stimuli rendered on the mobile BCIs. Finally, this study performed an online test with the Tablet-based BCI system and obtained an averaged information transfer rate of 33.87 bits/min in three subjects. The current integration leads to a truly practical and ubiquitous SSVEP BCI on mobile devices for real-life applications.",
   "Inferring the stability of LIFE through Brain Machine Interfaces.\nWe examine neural signals from Longitudinally implanted Intra-Fascicular Electrodes (LIFE) in a chronic, rabbit model. Translation-invariant wavelet de-noising methods are used to improve S%R. Then traditional template-based spike sorting is applied to discriminate single units. We investigate the effect of discriminating between identified units on Brain Machine Interface (BMI) decoding performance. We infer the stability of LIFE based on decoding performance with and without current BMI methods to counter-act electrode neural signal degradation.",
   "Electrode channel selection based on backtracking search optimization in motor imagery brain-computer interfaces.\nCommon spatial pattern algorithm is widely used to estimate spatial filters in motor imagery based brain-computer interfaces. However, use of a large number of channels will make common spatial pattern tend to over-fitting and the classification of electroencephalographic signals time-consuming. To overcome these problems, it is necessary to choose an optimal subset of the whole channels to save computational time and improve the classification accuracy. In this paper, a novel method named backtracking search optimization algorithm is proposed to automatically select the optimal channel set for common spatial pattern. Each individual in the population is a N-dimensional vector, with each component representing one channel. A\u00a0population of binary codes generate randomly in the beginning, and then channels are selected according to the evolution of these codes. The number and positions of 1's in the code denote the number and positions of chosen channels. The objective function of backtracking search optimization algorithm is defined as the combination of classification error rate and relative number of channels. Experimental results suggest that higher classification accuracy can be achieved with much fewer channels compared to standard common spatial pattern with whole channels.",
   "Statistical spatial filtering for a P300-based BCI: tests in able-bodied, and patients with cerebral palsy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\nThe effective use of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in real-world environments depends on a satisfactory throughput. In a P300-based BCI, this can be attained by reducing the number of trials needed to detect the P300 signal. However, this task is hampered by the very low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of P300 event related potentials. This paper proposes an efficient methodology that achieves high classification accuracy and high transfer rates for both disabled and able-bodied subjects in a standard P300-based speller system. The system was tested by three subjects with cerebral palsy (CP), two subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and nineteen able-bodied subjects. The paper proposes the application of three statistical spatial filters. The first is a beamformer that maximizes the ratio of signal power and noise power (Max-SNR). The second is a beamformer based on the Fisher criterion (FC). The third approach cascades the FC beamformer with the Max-SNR beamformer satisfying simultaneously sub-optimally both criteria (C-FMS). The calibration process of the BCI system takes about 5 min to collect data and a couple of minutes to obtain spatial filters and classification models. Online results showed that subjects with disabilities have achieved, on average, an accuracy and transfer rate only slightly lower than able-bodied subjects. Taking 23 of the 24 participants, the averaged results achieved a transfer rate of 4.33 symbols per minute with a 91.80% accuracy, corresponding to a bandwidth of 19.18 bits per minute. This study shows the feasibility of the proposed methodology and that effective communication rates are achievable.",

This technology will ultimately be used in real-world environments which include the presence of distractors. The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of visual distractors on BCI performance.",
   "Epidural electrocorticography for monitoring of arousal in locked-in state.\nElectroencephalography (EEG) often fails to assess both the level (i.e., arousal) and the content (i.e., awareness) of pathologically altered consciousness in patients without motor responsiveness. This might be related to a decline of awareness, to episodes of low arousal and disturbed sleep patterns, and/or to distorting and attenuating effects of the skull and intermediate tissue on the recorded brain signals. Novel approaches are required to overcome these limitations. We introduced epidural electrocorticography (ECoG) for monitoring of cortical physiology in a late-stage amytrophic lateral sclerosis patient in completely locked-in state (CLIS). Despite long-term application for a period of six months, no implant-related complications occurred. Recordings from the left frontal cortex were sufficient to identify three arousal states. Spectral analysis of the intrinsic oscillatory activity enabled us to extract state-dependent dominant frequencies at <4, ~7 and ~20 Hz, representing sleep-like periods, and phases of low and elevated arousal, respectively. In the absence of other biomarkers, ECoG proved to be a reliable tool for monitoring circadian rhythmicity, i.e., avoiding interference with the patient when he was sleeping and exploiting time windows of responsiveness. Moreover, the effects of interventions addressing the patient's arousal, e.g., amantadine medication, could be evaluated objectively on the basis of physiological markers, even in the absence of behavioral parameters. Epidural ECoG constitutes a feasible trade-off between surgical risk and quality of recorded brain signals to gain information on the patient's present level of arousal. This approach enables us to optimize the timing of interactions and medical interventions, all of which should take place when the patient is in a phase of high arousal. Furthermore, avoiding low-responsiveness periods will facilitate measures to implement alternative communication pathways involving brain-computer interfaces (BCI).",
   "Automated Classification and Removal of EEG Artifacts With SVM and Wavelet-ICA.\nBrain electrical activity recordings by electroencephalography (EEG) are often contaminated with signal artifacts. Procedures for automated removal of EEG artifacts are frequently sought for clinical diagnostics and brain-computer interface applications. In recent years, a combination of independent component analysis (ICA) and discrete wavelet transform has been introduced as standard technique for EEG artifact removal. However, in performing the wavelet-ICA procedure, visual inspection or arbitrary thresholding may be required for identifying artifactual components in the EEG signal. We now propose a novel approach for identifying artifactual components separated by wavelet-ICA using a pretrained support vector machine (SVM). Our method presents a robust and extendable system that enables fully automated identification and removal of artifacts from EEG signals, without applying any arbitrary thresholding. Using test data contaminated by eye blink artifacts, we show that our method performed better in identifying artifactual components than did existing thresholding methods. Furthermore, wavelet-ICA in conjunction with SVM successfully removed target artifacts, while largely retaining the EEG source signals of interest. We propose a set of features including kurtosis, variance, Shannon's entropy, and range of amplitude as training and test data of SVM to identify eye blink artifacts in EEG signals. This combinatorial method is also extendable to accommodate multiple types of artifacts present in multichannel EEG. We envision future research to explore other descriptive features corresponding to other types of artifactual components.",

   "Classification of Targets and Distractors Present in Visual Hemifields Using Time-Frequency Domain EEG Features.\nThis paper presents a classification system to classify the cognitive load corresponding to targets and distractors present in opposite visual hemifields. The approach includes the study of EEG (electroencephalogram) signal features acquired in a spatial attention task. The process comprises of EEG feature selection based on the feature distribution, followed by the stepwise discriminant analysis- (SDA-) based channel selection. Repeated measure analysis of variance (rANOVA) is applied to test the statistical significance of the selected features. Classifiers are developed and compared using the selected features to classify the target and distractor present in visual hemifields. The results provide a maximum classification accuracy of 87.2% and 86.1% and an average classification accuracy of 76.5\u2009\u00b1\u20094% and 76.2\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3% over the thirteen subjects corresponding to the two task conditions. These correlates present a step towards building a feature-based neurofeedback system for visual attention.",
   "Investigating Ensemble Learning and Classifier Generalization in a Hybrid, Passive Brain-Computer Interface for Assessing Cognitive Workload.\nHybrid, passive brain-computer (h/pBCI) interfaces have received much attention in regards to measuring various mental states. A high classification rate of operator workload state is necessary in order to be able to enhance operator performance. Physiological measures have been used with machine learning algorithms to classify workload state, however, these measures are hypothesized to suffer from inherent nonstationarity. To attain a more generalizable classifier, a prior solution has been to use a multi-day learning paradigm to train classifier models. In earlier work, we have shown that increasing the number of unique data sessions used to form a learning set can improve the accuracy of classifying mental workload where improved generalizability is partly attributable to the multi-day paradigm. To further investigate methods that produce more generalizable classifiers, we look to ensemble learning. Here we implement ensemble learning to increase accuracies, reduce variance, and leverage theoretical performance of the ensemble as compared to observed to make inference about generalization. An adaptive boosting method (AdaBoost) is used to train a \"base learning algorithm\" multiple times, adaptively adjusting to errors and forming a vote out of the resulting hypotheses using three different base learning algorithms: an artificial neural network (ANN), a support vector machine (SVM), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). We observed that the ensemble converged on theoretical performance with respect to error and variance only when the training sets were formed using the multi-day paradigm. These results indicate that ensemble learning approaches can be used in examples of pBCI such as those designed here, but they are also affected by theorized nonstationarity in physiological response. The observation of ensemble convergence on theoretical performance may be used to make inference about generalizability when simple accuracy of detection can be misleading.",

   "Measuring and monitoring emotional changes in children who stutter.\nThe assessment of clients with speech disorders presents challenges for speech-language pathologists. For example, having a reliable way of measuring the severity of the case, determining which remedial program is aligned with a patient's needs, and measuring of treatment processes. There is potential for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications to enhance speech therapy sessions by providing objective insights and real-time visualization of brain activity during the sessions. This paper presents a study on emotional state detection during speech pathology. The goal of this study is to investigate affective-motivational brain responses to stimuli in children who stutter. To this end, we conducted an experiment that involved recording frontal electroencephalography (EEG) activity from fifteen children with stuttering whilst they looked at visual stimuli. The contribution of our study is to provide a comprehensive background and a framework for emotional state detection experiments as assessment and monitoring tool in speech pathology. It mainly discusses the feasibility and potential benefits of applying EEG-based emotion detection in speech-language therapy contexts of use. The findings of our research indicate that emotional recognition using non-invasive EEG-based BCI system is sufficient to differentiate between affective states of individuals in treatment contexts.",
   "[A novel method of multi-channel feature extraction combining multivariate autoregression and multiple-linear principal component analysis].\nBrain-computer interface (BCI) systems identify brain signals through extracting features from them. In view of the limitations of the autoregressive model feature extraction method and the traditional principal component analysis to deal with the multichannel signals, this paper presents a multichannel feature extraction method that multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model combined with the multiple-linear principal component analysis (MPCA), and used for magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals and electroencephalograph (EEG) signals recognition. Firstly, we calculated the MVAR model coefficient matrix of the MEG/EEG signals using this method, and then reduced the dimensions to a lower one, using MPCA. Finally, we recognized brain signals by Bayes Classifier. The key innovation we introduced in our investigation showed that we extended the traditional single-channel feature extraction method to the case of multi-channel one. We then carried out the experiments using the data groups of IV-III and IV - I. The experimental results proved that the method proposed in this paper was feasible.",
   "Augmentation-related brain plasticity.\nToday, the anthropomorphism of the tools and the development of neural interfaces require reconsidering the concept of human-tools interaction in the framework of human augmentation. This review analyses the plastic process that the brain undergoes when it comes into contact with augmenting artificial sensors and effectors and, on the other hand, the changes that the use of external augmenting devices produces in the brain. Hitherto, few studies investigated the neural correlates of augmentation, but clues on it can be borrowed from logically-related paradigms: sensorimotor training, cognitive enhancement, cross-modal plasticity, sensorimotor functional substitution, use and embodiment of tools. Augmentation modifies function and structure of a number of areas, i.e., primary sensory cortices shape their receptive fields to become sensitive to novel inputs. Motor areas adapt the neuroprosthesis representation firing-rate to refine kinematics. As for normal motor outputs, the learning process recruits motor and premotor cortices and the acquisition of proficiency decreases attentional recruitment, focuses the activity on sensorimotor areas and increases the basal ganglia drive on the cortex. Augmentation deeply relies on the frontoparietal network. In particular, premotor cortex is involved in learning the control of an external effector and owns the tool motor representation, while the intraparietal sulcus extracts its visual features. In these areas, multisensory integration neurons enlarge their receptive fields to embody supernumerary limbs. For operating an anthropomorphic neuroprosthesis, the mirror system is required to understand the meaning of the action, the cerebellum for the formation of its internal model and the insula for its interoception. In conclusion, anthropomorphic sensorized devices can provide the critical sensory afferences to evolve the exploitation of tools through their embodiment, reshaping the body representation and the sense of the self.",
   "[EEG feature extraction based on quantum particle swarm optimizer and independent component analysis].\nFeature extraction is a very crucial step in P300-based brain-computer interface (BCI) and independent component analysis (ICA) is a suitable P300 feature extraction method. But at present the convergence performance of the general ICA iteration methods are not very satisfactory. In this paper, a method based on quantum particle swarm optimizer (QPSO) algorithm and ICA technique is put forward for P300 extraction. In this method, quantum computing is used to impel ICA iteration to globally converge faster. It achieved the purpose of extracting P300 rapidly and efficiently. The method was tested on two public datasets of BCI Competition II and III, and a simple linear classifier was employed to classify the extracted P300 features. The recognition accuracy reached 94.4% with 15 times averaged. The results showed that the proposed method could extract P300 rapidly and the extraction effect did not reduce. It provides an experimental basis for further study of real-time BCI system.",
   "Stimulus-driven changes in sensorimotor behavior and neuronal functional connectivity application to brain-machine interfaces and neurorehabilitation.\nNormal brain function requires constant adaptation as an organism interacts with the environment and learns to associate important sensory stimuli with appropriate motor actions. Neurological disorders may disrupt these learned associations, potentially requiring new functional pathways to be formed to replace the lost function. As a consequence, neural plasticity is a critical aspect of both normal brain function as well as the response to neurological injury. A brain-machine interface (BMI) represents a unique adaptive challenge to the nervous system. Efferent BMIs have been developed, which harness signals recorded from a tiny proportion of the motor cortex (M1) to effect control of an external device. There is also interest in the development of an afferent BMI that would supply information directly to the brain (e.g., the somatosensory cortex-S1) via electrical stimulation. If a bidirectional BMI that combined these interfaces were to be successful, new functional pathways would be necessary between the artificial inputs and outputs. Indeed, stimulation of S1 that is contingent upon the consequences of motor command signals recorded from M1 might form the basis for artificial Hebbian associations not unlike those driving learning in the normal brain. In this chapter, we review recent developments in both efferent and afferent BMIs, as well as experimental attempts to understand and mimic the Hebbian processes that give rise to plastic changes within the cortex. We have used a rat model to develop the computational and experimental tools necessary to describe changes in the way small networks of sensorimotor neurons interact and process information. We show that by repetitively pairing the recorded spikes of one neuron with electrical stimulation of another or by repetitively pairing electrical stimulation of two neurons, we can strengthen the inferred functional connection between the pair of neurons. We have also used the dual-stimulation protocol to enhance the ability of a trained rat to detect intracortical microstimulation behavioral cues. These results provide an important proof of concept, demonstrating the feasibility of Hebbian conditioning protocols to alter information flow in the brain. In addition to their possible application to BMI research, techniques like this may improve the efficacy of traditional rehabilitation for patients with neurologic injury.",
   "A robust and subject-specific sequential forward search method for effective channel selection in brain computer interfaces.\nThe input signals of electroencephalography (EEG) based brain computer interfaces (BCI) are extensively acquired from scalp with a multi-channel system.

Furthermore, using only effective channels, rather than all channels, may enhance the performance of the BCI in terms of classification accuracy (CA).",
   "Self-Regulation of the Fusiform Face Area in Autism Spectrum: A Feasibility Study With Real-Time fMRI Neurofeedback.\nOne of the most important and early impairments in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the abnormal visual processing of human faces. This deficit has been associated with hypoactivation of the fusiform face area (FFA), one of the main hubs of the face-processing network. Neurofeedback based on real-time fMRI (rtfMRI-NF) is a technique that allows the self-regulation of circumscribed brain regions, leading to specific neural modulation and behavioral changes. The aim of the present study was to train participants with ASD to achieve up-regulation of the FFA using rtfMRI-NF, to investigate the neural effects of FFA up-regulation in ASD. For this purpose, three groups of volunteers with normal I.Q. and fluent language were recruited to participate in a rtfMRI-NF protocol of eight training runs in 2 days. Five subjects with ASD participated as part of the experimental group and received contingent feedback to up-regulate bilateral FFA. Two control groups, each one with three participants with typical development (TD), underwent the same protocol: one group with contingent feedback and the other with sham feedback. Whole-brain and functional connectivity analysis using each fusiform gyrus as independent seeds were carried out. The results show that individuals with TD and ASD can achieve FFA up-regulation with contingent feedback. RtfMRI-NF in ASD produced more numerous and stronger short-range connections among brain areas of the ventral visual stream and an absence of the long-range connections to insula and inferior frontal gyrus, as observed in TD subjects. Recruitment of inferior frontal gyrus was observed in both groups during FAA up-regulation. However, insula and caudate nucleus were only recruited in subjects with TD. These results could be explained from a neurodevelopment perspective as a lack of the normal specialization of visual processing areas, and a compensatory mechanism to process visual information of faces. RtfMRI-NF emerges as a potential tool to study visual processing network in ASD, and to explore its clinical potential.",
   "An integrated neuro-robotic interface for stroke rehabilitation using the NASA X1 powered lower limb exoskeleton.\nStroke remains a leading cause of disability, limiting independent ambulation in survivors, and consequently affecting quality of life (QOL). Recent technological advances in neural interfacing with robotic rehabilitation devices are promising in the context of gait rehabilitation. Here, the X1, NASA's powered robotic lower limb exoskeleton, is introduced as a potential diagnostic, assistive, and therapeutic tool for stroke rehabilitation. Additionally, the feasibility of decoding lower limb joint kinematics and kinetics during walking with the X1 from scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) signals--the first step towards the development of a brain-machine interface (BMI) system to the X1 exoskeleton--is demonstrated.",
   "EEG single-trial classification of visual, auditive and vibratory feedback potentials in Brain-Computer Interfaces.\nFeedback stimuli are fundamental components in Brain-Computer Interfaces. It is known that the presentation of feedback stimuli elicits certain brain potentials that can be measured and classified. As stimuli can be given through different sensory modalities, it is important to understand the effects of different types of feedback on brain responses and their impact on classification. This paper presents a protocol used to obtain brain potentials elicited by visual, auditive or vibrotactile feedback stimuli. Experiments were carried out with five different subjects for each modality. Four different single-trial classification strategies were compared, according to the information used to train the classifier, achieving a classification rate of approximately 80% for each modality.",
   "\u03bc-Foil Polymer Electrode Array for Intracortical Neural Recordings.\nWe have developed a multichannel electrode array-termed [Formula: see text]-foil-that comprises ultrathin and flexible electrodes protruding from a thin foil at fixed distances. In addition to allowing some of the active sites to reach less compromised tissue, the barb-like protrusions that also serves the purpose of anchoring the electrode array into the tissue. This paper is an early evaluation of technical aspects and performance of this electrode array in acute in vitro/in vivo experiments. The interface impedance was reduced by up to two decades by electroplating the active sites with platinum black. The platinum black also allowed for a reduced phase lag for higher frequency components. The distance between the protrusions of the electrode array was tailored to match the architecture of the rat cerebral cortex. In vivo acute measurements confirmed a high signal-to-noise ratio for the neural recordings, and no significant crosstalk between recording channels.",
   "Effect of a combination of flip and zooming stimuli on the performance of a visual brain-computer interface for spelling.\nBrain-computer interface (BCI) systems can allow their users to communicate with the external world by recognizing intention directly from their brain activity without the assistance of the peripheral motor nervous system. The P300-speller is one of the most widely used visual BCI applications. In previous studies, a flip stimulus (rotating the background area of the character) that was based on apparent motion, suffered from less refractory effects. However, its performance was not improved significantly. In addition, a presentation paradigm that used a \"zooming\" action (changing the size of the symbol) has been shown to evoke relatively higher P300 amplitudes and obtain a better BCI performance. To extend this method of stimuli presentation within a BCI and, consequently, to improve BCI performance, we present a new paradigm combining both the flip stimulus with a zooming action. This new presentation modality allowed BCI users to focus their attention more easily. We investigated whether such an action could combine the advantages of both types of stimuli presentation to bring a significant improvement in performance compared to the conventional flip stimulus. The experimental results showed that the proposed paradigm could obtain significantly higher classification accuracies and bit rates than the conventional flip paradigm (p<0.01).",
   "Cognitive-motor brain-machine interfaces.\nBrain-machine interfaces (BMIs) open new horizons for the treatment of paralyzed persons, giving hope for the artificial restoration of lost physiological functions. Whereas BMI development has mainly focused on motor rehabilitation, recent studies have suggested that higher cognitive functions can also be deciphered from brain activity, bypassing low level planning and execution functions, and replacing them by computer-controlled effectors. This review describes the new generation of cognitive-motor BMIs, focusing on three BMI types: By outlining recent progress in developing these BMI types, we aim to provide a unified view of contemporary research towards the replacement of behavioral outputs of cognitive processes by direct interaction with the brain.",
   "Beyond astronaut's capabilities: The current state of the art.\nSpace agencies have developed extensive expertise with sustaining human presence in low earth orbits and microgravity. Prolonged human presence in space beyond Earth\u00e2\u0102\u0179s orbit presents additional, some still unsolved issues. These are linked to the distance to Earth (impossibility of effective tele-operation, psychological effects linked to remoteness from Earth, required autonomy, the handling of emergencies, long mission durations), and to the environments beyond the Earth magnetosphere (radiation levels, local environments including atmospheres, dust, gravity, day-night cycles). These issues have impacts on the spacecraft design, the mission operations, astronaut selection and preparation and required supporting/ enabling technologies. This paper builds upon previous work by Rossini et al. , in critically reviewing and updating the current state of scientific research on enhancing astronaut's capabilities to face some of these challenges. In particular, it discusses the pertinence and feasibility of two approaches aiming at enhancing the chances of success of human missions: induced hibernation state and brain-machine interfaces.",

   "Bone Mineral Density Testing in Spinal Cord Injury: 2019 ISCD Official Position.\nSpinal cord injury (SCI) causes rapid osteoporosis that is most severe below the level of injury. More than half of those with motor complete SCI will experience an osteoporotic fracture at some point following their injury, with most fractures occurring at the distal femur and proximal tibia. These fractures have devastating consequences, including delayed union or nonunion, cellulitis, skin breakdown, lower extremity amputation, and premature death. Maintaining skeletal integrity and preventing fractures is imperative following SCI to fully benefit from future advances in paralysis cure research and robotic-exoskeletons, brain computer interfaces and other evolving technologies. Clinical care has been previously limited by the lack of consensus derived guidelines or standards regarding dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry-based diagnosis of osteoporosis, fracture risk prediction, or monitoring response to therapies. The International Society of Clinical Densitometry convened a task force to establish Official Positions for bone density assessment by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in individuals with SCI of traumatic or nontraumatic etiology. This task force conducted a series of systematic reviews to guide the development of evidence-based position statements that were reviewed by an expert panel at the 2019 Position Development Conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The resulting the International Society of Clinical Densitometry Official Positions are intended to inform clinical care and guide the diagnosis of osteoporosis as well as fracture risk management of osteoporosis following SCI.",
   "Sub-mm functional decoupling of electrocortical signals through closed-loop BMI learning.\nVolitional control of neural activity lies at the heart of the Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) paradigm. In this work we investigated if subdural field potentials recorded by electrodes < 1mm apart can be decoupled through closed-loop BMI learning. To this end, we fabricated custom, flexible microelectrode arrays with 200 \u00b5m electrode pitch and increased the effective electrode area by electrodeposition of platinum black to reduce thermal noise. We have chronically implanted these arrays subdurally over primary motor cortex (M1) of 5 male Long-Evans Rats and monitored the electrochemical electrode impedance in vivo to assess the stability of these neural interfaces. We successfully trained the rodents to perform a one-dimensional center-out task using closed-loop brain control to adjust the pitch of an auditory cursor by differentially modulating high gamma (70-110 Hz) power on pairs of surface microelectrodes that were separated by less than 1 mm.",
   "True zero-training brain-computer interfacing--an online study.\nDespite several approaches to realize subject-to-subject transfer of pre-trained classifiers, the full performance of a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for a novel user can only be reached by presenting the BCI system with data from the novel user. In typical state-of-the-art BCI systems with a supervised classifier, the labeled data is collected during a calibration recording, in which the user is asked to perform a specific task. Based on the known labels of this recording, the BCI's classifier can learn to decode the individual's brain signals. Unfortunately, this calibration recording consumes valuable time. Furthermore, it is unproductive with respect to the final BCI application, e.g. text entry. Therefore, the calibration period must be reduced to a minimum, which is especially important for patients with a limited concentration ability. The main contribution of this manuscript is an online study on unsupervised learning in an auditory event-related potential (ERP) paradigm. Our results demonstrate that the calibration recording can be bypassed by utilizing an unsupervised trained classifier, that is initialized randomly and updated during usage. Initially, the unsupervised classifier tends to make decoding mistakes, as the classifier might not have seen enough data to build a reliable model. Using a constant re-analysis of the previously spelled symbols, these initially misspelled symbols can be rectified posthoc when the classifier has learned to decode the signals. We compare the spelling performance of our unsupervised approach and of the unsupervised posthoc approach to the standard supervised calibration-based dogma for n = 10 healthy users. To assess the learning behavior of our approach, it is unsupervised trained from scratch three times per user. Even with the relatively low SNR of an auditory ERP paradigm, the results show that after a limited number of trials (30 trials), the unsupervised approach performs comparably to a classic supervised model.",
   "Explorative data analysis for changes in neural activity.\nNeural recordings are non-stationary time series, i.e. their properties typically change over time. Identifying specific changes, e.g., those induced by a learning task, can shed light on the underlying neural processes. However, such changes of interest are often masked by strong unrelated changes, which can be of physiological origin or due to measurement artifacts. We propose a novel algorithm for disentangling such different causes of non-stationarity and in this manner enable better neurophysiological interpretation for a wider set of experimental paradigms. A key ingredient is the repeated application of Stationary Subspace Analysis (SSA) using different temporal scales. The usefulness of our explorative approach is demonstrated in simulations, theory and EEG experiments with 80 brain-computer interfacing subjects.",
   "Noise enhanced array signal detection in P300 speller paradigm using ICA-based subspace projections.\nThis paper explores how noise can improve prediction accuracy of the Event-Related Potential (ERP) based on P300 signals. We propose an array of ICA-Based P300 processing systems with additive white Gaussian noise. The array system attains maximum accuracy when noise intensity is not zero and thus the system shows the stochastic resonance effect. The prediction accuracy increases as the number of stages of the array increases. Experimental results show that increasing the array size with the proper amount of noise can improve the accuracy of the original P300 signal detection using ICA-based subspace projection technique.",

   "Operator control of interneural computing machines.\nA dynamic representation of neural population responses asserts that motor cortex is a flexible pattern generator sending rhythmic, oscillatory signals to generate multiphasic patterns of movement. This raises a question concerning the design and control of new computing machines that mimic the oscillatory patterns and multiphasic patterns seen in neural systems. To address this issue, we design an interneural computing machine (INCM) made of plastic random interneural connections. We develop a mechanical way to measure collective ensemble firing of neurons in INCM. Two sorts of plasticity operators are derived from the measure of synchronous neural activity and the measure of self-sustaining neural activity, respectively. Such plasticity operators conduct activity-dependent operation to modify the network structure of INCM. The activity-dependent operation meets the neurobiological perspective of Hebbian synaptic plasticity and displays the tendency toward circulation breaking aiming to control neural population dynamics. We call such operation operator control of INCM and develop a population analysis of operator control for measuring how well single neurons of INCM can produce rhythmic, oscillatory activity, but at the level of neural ensembles, generate multiphasic patterns of population responses.",
   "Whatever works: a systematic user-centered training protocol to optimize brain-computer interfacing individually.\nThis study implemented a systematic user-centered training protocol for a 4-class brain-computer interface (BCI). The goal was to optimize the BCI individually in order to achieve high performance within few sessions for all users. Eight able-bodied volunteers, who were initially na\u00efve to the use of a BCI, participated in 10 sessions over a period of about 5 weeks. In an initial screening session, users were asked to perform the following seven mental tasks while multi-channel EEG was recorded: mental rotation, word association, auditory imagery, mental subtraction, spatial navigation, motor imagery of the left hand and motor imagery of both feet. Out of these seven mental tasks, the best 4-class combination as well as most reactive frequency band (between 8-30 Hz) was selected individually for online control. Classification was based on common spatial patterns and Fisher's linear discriminant analysis. The number and time of classifier updates varied individually. Selection speed was increased by reducing trial length. To minimize differences in brain activity between sessions with and without feedback, sham feedback was provided in the screening and calibration runs in which usually no real-time feedback is shown. Selected task combinations and frequency ranges differed between users. The tasks that were included in the 4-class combination most often were (1) motor imagery of the left hand (2), one brain-teaser task (word association or mental subtraction) (3), mental rotation task and (4) one more dynamic imagery task (auditory imagery, spatial navigation, imagery of the feet). Participants achieved mean performances over sessions of 44-84% and peak performances in single-sessions of 58-93% in this user-centered 4-class BCI protocol. This protocol is highly adjustable to individual users and thus could increase the percentage of users who can gain and maintain BCI control. A high priority for future work is to examine this protocol with severely disabled users.",
   "Super multi-channel recording systems with UWB wireless transmitter for BMI.\nIn order to realize a low-invasive and high accuracy Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) system for clinical applications, a super multi-channel recording system was developed in which 4096 channels of Electrocorticogram (ECoG) signal can be amplified and transmitted to outside the body by using an Ultra Wide Band (UWB) wireless system. Also, a high density, flexible electrode array made by using a Parylene-C substrate was developed that is composed of units of 32-ch recording arrays. We have succeeded in an evaluation test of UWB wireless transmitting using a body phantom system.",
   "Decoding unconstrained arm movements in primates using high-density electrocorticography signals for brain-machine interface use.\nMotor deficit is among the most debilitating aspects of injury to the central nervous system. Despite ongoing progress in brain-machine interface (BMI) development and in the functional electrical stimulation of muscles and nerves, little is understood about how neural signals in the brain may be used to potentially control movement in one's own unconstrained paralyzed limb. We recorded from high-density electrocorticography (ECoG) electrode arrays in the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) of a rhesus macaque and used real-time motion tracking techniques to correlate spatial-temporal changes in neural activity with arm movements made towards objects in three-dimensional space at millisecond precision. We found that neural activity from a small number of electrodes within the PMv can be used to accurately predict reach-return movement onset and directionality. Also, whereas higher gamma frequency field activity was more predictive about movement direction during performance, mid-band (beta and low gamma) activity was more predictive of movement prior to onset. We speculate these dual spatiotemporal signals may be used to optimize both planning and execution of movement during natural reaching, with prospective relevance to the future development of neural prosthetics aimed at restoring motor control over one's own paralyzed limb.",
   "Multi-class EEG classification of motor imagery signal by finding optimal time segments and features using SNR-based mutual information.\nThe electroencephalogram signals are used to distinguish different motor imagery tasks in brain-computer interfaces. In most studies, in order to classify the EEG signals recorded in a cue-guided BCI paradigm, time segments for feature extraction after the onset of the visual cue were selected manually. In addition, in these studies the authors have selected a single identical time segment for different subjects. The present study emphasized on the inter-individual variability and difference between different motor imagery tasks as the potential source of erroneous results and used mutual information and the subject specific time interval to overcome this problem. More specifically, a new method was proposed to automatically find the best subject specific time intervals for the classification of four-class motor imagery tasks by using MI between the BCI input and output. Moreover, the signal-to-noise ratio was used to calculate the MI values, while the MI values were used as feature selection criteria to select the discriminative features. The time segments and the best discriminative features were found by using training data and used to assess the evaluation data. Furthermore, the CSP algorithm was used to extract signal features. The dataset 2A of BCI competition IV used in this study consisted of four different motor imagery signals, which were obtained from nine different subjects. One Vs One decomposition scheme was used to deal with the multi-class nature of the problem. The MI values showed that the obtained time segments not only varied between different subjects but also varied between different classifiers of different pair of classes. Finally, the results suggested that the proposed method was efficient in classifying multi-class motor imagery signals as compared to other classification strategies proposed by the other studies.",
   "Exploiting Electrocorticographic Spectral Characteristics for Optimized Signal Chain Design: A 1.08 Analog Front End With Reduced ADC Resolution Requirements.\nElectrocorticography (ECoG) is an important area of research for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) development. ECoG, along with some other biopotentials, has spectral characteristics that can be exploited for more optimal front-end performance than is achievable with conventional techniques. This paper optimizes noise performance of such a system and discusses an equalization technique that reduces the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) dynamic range requirements and eliminates the need for a variable gain amplifier (VGA). We demonstrate a fabricated prototype in 1p9m 65 nm CMOS that takes advantage of the presented findings to achieve high-fidelity, full-spectrum ECoG recording. It requires 1.08 \u03bcW over a 150 Hz bandwidth for the entire analog front end and only 7 bits of ADC resolution.",
   "Real-time control of an interactive impulsive virtual prosthesis.\nAn interactive virtual dynamic environment for testing control strategies for neural machine interfacing with artificial limbs offers several advantages. The virtual environment is low-cost, easily configured, and offers a wealth of data for post-hoc analysis compared with real physical prostheses and robots. For use with prosthetics and research involving amputee subjects it allows the valuable time with the subject to be spent in experiments rather than fixing hardware issues. The usefulness of the virtual environment increases as the realism of the environment increases. Most tasks performed with limbs require interactions with objects in the environment. To simulate these tasks the dynamics of frictional contact, in addition to inertial limb dynamics must be modeled. Here, subjects demonstrate real-time control of an eight degree-of-freedom virtual prosthesis while performing an interactive box-and-blocks task. With practice, four nonamputee subjects and one shoulder disarticulation subject were able to successfully transfer blocks in the virtual environment at an average rate of just under two blocks per minute. The virtual environment is configurable in terms of the virtual arm design, control strategy, and task.",
   "Direct comparison of supervised and semi-supervised retraining approaches for co-adaptive BCIs.\nFor Brain-Computer interfaces (BCIs), system calibration is a lengthy but necessary process for successful operation. Co-adaptive BCIs aim to shorten training and imply positive motivation to users by presenting feedback already at early stages: After just 5\u00a0min of gathering calibration data, the systems are able to provide feedback and engage users in a mutual learning process. In this work, we investigate whether the retraining stage of co-adaptive BCIs can be adapted to a semi-supervised concept, where only a small amount of labeled data is available and all additional data needs to be labeled by the BCI itself. The aim of the current work was to evaluate whether a semi-supervised co-adaptive BCI could successfully compete with a supervised co-adaptive BCI model. In a supporting two-class (190 trials per condition) BCI study based on motor imagery tasks, we evaluated both approaches in two separate groups of 10 participants online, while we simulated the other approach in each group offline. Our results indicate that despite the lack of true labeled data, the semi-supervised driven BCI did not perform significantly worse (p\u00a0>\u20090.05) than the supervised counterpart. We believe that these findings contribute to developing BCIs for long-term use, where continuous adaptation becomes imperative for maintaining meaningful BCI performance. Graphical abstract In this work, we investigate whether the retraining stage of a co-adaptive BCI can be adapted to a semi-supervised concept, where only a small amount of labeled data is available and all additional data needs to be labeled by the BCI itself. In two groups of 10 persons, we evaluate a supervised as well as a semi-supervised approach. Our results indicate that despite the lack of true labeled data, the semi-supervised driven BCI did not perform significantly worse (p\u00a0>\u20090.05) than the supervised counterpart.",
   "Synthesis of Water-Dispersible Molecularly Imprinted Electroactive Nanoparticles for the Sensitive and Selective Paracetamol Detection.\nA novel kind of water-dispersible molecularly imprinted electroactive nanoparticles was prepared combining macromolecular self-assembly with molecularly imprinting technique employing paracetamol (PCM) as template molecule. An amphiphilic electroactive copolymer (P(NVC-EHA-AA), PNEA) containing carbazole group was first synthesized through a one-pot free radical copolymerization. The coassembly of the electroactive copolymers with the template molecules (PCM) in aqueous solution generated nanoparticles embedded with PCM, leading to the formation of molecularly imprinted electroactive nanoparticles (MIENPs). A robust MIP film was formed on the surface of electrode by electrodeposition of MIENPs and subsequent electropolymerization of the carbazole units in MIENPs. After the extraction of PCM molecules, a MIP sensor was successfully constructed. It should be noted that electropolymerization of the electroactive units in MIENPs creates cross-conjugated polymer network, which not only locks the recognition sites but also significantly accelerates the electron transfer and thus enhances the response signal of the MIP sensor. These advantages endowed the MIP sensor with good selectivity and high sensitivity for PCM detection. The MIP sensor could recognize PCM from its possible interfering substances with good selectivity. Under the optimal conditions, two linear ranges from 1 \u03bcM to 0.1 mM and 0.1 to 10 mM with a detection limit of 0.3 \u03bcM were obtained for PCM detection. The MIP sensor also showed good stability and repeatability, which has been successfully used to analyze PCM in tablets and human urine samples with satisfactory results.",
   "Sensitive and selective determination of gallic acid in green tea samples based on an electrochemical platform of poly(melamine) film.\nIn this work, an electrochemical sensor coupled with an effective flow-injection amperometry (FIA) system is developed, targeting the determination of gallic acid (GA) in a mild neutral condition, in contrast to the existing electrochemical methods. The sensor is based on a thin electroactive poly(melamine) film immobilized on a pre-anodized screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE*/PME). The characteristics of the sensing surface are well-characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and surface water contact angle experiments. The proposed assay exhibits a wide linear response to GA in both pH 3 and pH 7.0 phosphate buffer solutions (PBS) under the optimized flow-injection amperometry. The detection limit (S/N\u00a0=\u00a03) is 0.076\u00a0\u03bcM and 0.21\u00a0\u03bcM in the pH 3 and pH 7 solutions, respectively. A relative standard deviation (RSD) of 3.9% is obtained for 57 successive measurements of 50\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0GA in pH 7 solutions. Interference studies indicate that some inorganic salts, catechol, caffeine and ascorbic acid do not interfere with the GA assay. The interference effects from some orthodiphenolic compounds are also investigated. The proposed method and a conventional Folin-Ciocalteu method are applied to detect GA in green tea samples using the standard addition method, and satisfactory spiked recoveries are obtained.",
   "Synergistic contributions of fullerene, ferrocene, chitosan and ionic liquid towards improved performance for a glucose sensor.\nThe paper describes an ingenious approach for the fabrication of a promising glucose sensor, GOx/C(60)-Fc-CS-IL, that exploits the synergistic beneficial characteristics of fullerene (C(60)), ferrocene (Fc), chitosan (CS) and ionic liquid (IL) for glucose oxidase (GOx). Cyclic voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy and chronoamperometry were used to evaluate performance of the biosensor, respectively. Since efficient electron transfer between GOx and the electrode was achieved, the biosensor exhibits a high sensitivity (234.67 nA nM(-1) cm(-2)), low detection limit (S/N=3) (3x10(-9) M), fast response time (0.752 s), wide calibration range (from 1x10(-8) M to 1x10(-5) M) and excellent long-term stability (30 weeks). The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (K(M)) of GOx on the composite medium, 0.03 mM, shows high bioelectrocatalytic activity of immobilized enzyme toward glucose oxidation. Due to low operating potential (100 V), the biosensor is relatively insensitive to electroactive interfering species in human blood such as ascorbic acid, and uric acid, which are commonly found in blood samples. Excellent electrochemical reversibility, high sensitivity and stability, technically simple and possibility of preparation at short period of time are of great advantages of these glucose biosensors.",
   "N-Cadherin- and L1-functionalised conducting polymers for synergistic stimulation and guidance of neural cell growth.\nConducting polymers are promising materials for advanced neuroprostheses and neural repair devices. However, these challenging technologies demand stable presentation of multiple biomolecules on the polymer surface and fabrication of scaffolds suitable for implantation. We electrosynthesised poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly[(4-styrenesulfonic acid)-co-(maleic acid)] (PEDOT:PSS-co-MA) on gold-coated surfaces or carbon microfibres, functionalised the polymer by covalent immobilisation of anti-IgG antibodies and subsequent binding of N-Cadherin and L1 recombinant proteins, and used these materials as substrates for culturing cerebral cortex neurons. N-Cadherin and L1 were much more effective than polylysine in promoting axonal elongation and collateralisation on the polymer. However, N-Cadherin also induced cell migration and dendritic extension and branching, whereas L1 inhibited dendrites. Dual functionalisation with N-Cadherin and L1 produced synergistic effects on neuronal growth that could not be achieved with either of the proteins when used alone. PEDOT:PSS-co-MA electrosynthesised on carbon microfibres showed good electrochemical properties and, when biofunctionalised with N-Cadherin or L1, stimulated very long and guided axonal elongation. Finally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry showed that the good electrical properties of PEDOT:PSS-co-MA were not degraded by covalent peptide attachment, indicating that this polymer is suitable for multiple biofunctionalisation of electroactive surfaces in neuroprosthetic and lesion-bridging applications.",
   "New Spin on Organic Radical Batteries-An Isoindoline Nitroxide-Based High-Voltage Cathode Material.\nOrganic electrode materials are a highly promising and environmentally benign class of battery materials with radical polymers being at the forefront of this research. Herein, we report the first example of the 1,1,3,3-tetramethylisoindolin-2-yloxyl class of nitroxides as an organic electrode material and the synthesis and application of a novel styrenic nitroxide polymer, poly(5-vinyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethylisoindolin-2-yloxyl) (PVTMIO). The polymer was synthesized from the precursor monomer, 2-methoxy-5-vinyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethylisoindoline, and subsequent oxidative deprotection yielded the electroactive radical species. Cyclic voltammetry revealed a high oxidation potential of 3.7 V versus Li, placing it among the top of the nitroxide class of electrode materials. The suitability of PVTMIO for utilization in a high-voltage organic radical battery was confirmed with a discharge capacity of 104.7 mAh g-1, high rate performance, and stability under cycling conditions (90% capacity retention after 100 cycles), making it one of the highest reported organic p-dopable cathode materials.",
   "Recent development of interaction of transition metal complexes with DNA based on biosensor and its applications.\nIn this article interaction of transition metal complexes with DNA and its applications in electrochemical DNA biosensors as hybridization indicator or electroactive marker of DNA are reviewed. Special emphasis has been given to the efforts for the development of new transition metal complexes and their interaction to DNA. DNA and polymers covalently conjugated with transition metal complexes were also reviewed.",
   "Electroactive liquid lens driven by an annular membrane.\nUnlike traditional focalization that recruits multiple moving lens elements to adjust focus, liquid lenses deliver adaptive focusing by simply tuning the surface profile of liquid or the elastomer that encloses liquid. Its simple and compact configuration, low cost, and actuation efficiency promise wide industrial, medical, and consumer applications. Dielectric elastomers (DEs), one type of commercially available soft active material, have been a good fit for creating adaptive optics. In this Letter, we present an adaptive, membrane-sealed liquid lens hydrostatically coupled to a concentric annular DE actuator. Electric actuation deforms the annular DE, which induces fluid transmission between the lens part and the actuation part for lens actuation. The maximum measured focal range was from 25.4 to 105.2 mm within 1.0 kV, which significantly outperforms the existing DE-actuated liquid lenses and eliminates the need for prestraining. The lens also enables varied focal ranges by simply adjusting its initial surface sagitta, providing flexibility for practical imaging applications.",
   "DNA-based hybridization chain reaction for an ultrasensitive cancer marker EBNA-1 electrochemical immunosensor.\nAn ultrasensitive and selective electrochemical immunosensor was developed for the detection of Epstein Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1). Firstly, a suspension of graphene sheets (GS) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was prepared with the aid of chitosan (CS) solution and then modified on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were then electrodeposited onto the surface of the GS-MWCNTs film by cyclic voltammetry (CV) to immobilize the captured antibodies. After that, specific sandwich immunoreactions were formed among the captured antibody, EBNA-1, and secondary antibody, DNA-coated carboxyl multi-wall carbon nanotubes (DNA-MWCNTs-Ab2). DNA initiator strands (S0) and secondary antibodies linked to the MWCNTs and double-helix DNA polymers were obtained by hybridization chain reaction (HCR), and here S0 on the MWCNTs propagates a chain reaction of hybridization events between two alternating hairpins to form a nicked double-helix. Finally, electroactive indicator doxorubicin hydrochloride was intercalated into the CG-GC steps between the HCR products and could produce an electrochemical signal, which was monitored by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Under optimum conditions, the amperometric signal increased linearly with the target concentrations (0.05-6.4ngmL(-1)), and the immunosensor exhibited a detection limit as low as 0.7pgmL(-1) (S/N=3). The proposed method showed acceptable stability and reproducibility, as well as favorable recovery for EBNA-1 in human serum. The proposed immunosensor provides a novel avenue for signal amplification and potential applications in bioanalysis and clinical diagnostics.",
   "Assembly of electroactive layer-by-layer films of hemoglobin and polycationic poly(diallyldimethylammonium).\nLayer-by-layer (PDDA/Hb)(n) films were assembled by alternate adsorption of positively charged poly(diallyldimethylammonium) (PDDA) and negatively charged hemoglobin (Hb) at pH 9.2 from their aqueous solutions on pyrolytic graphite electrodes and other substrates. The assembly process was monitored and confirmed by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), UV-vis spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry (CV). CVs of (PDDA/Hb)(n) films showed a pair of well-defined, nearly reversible peaks at about -0.34 V vs SCE at pH 7.0, characteristic of Hb heme Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox couple. Positions of Soret absorption band and infrared amide II band of Hb in (PDDA/Hb)(8) films suggest that Hb in the films keeps its secondary structure similar to its native state. The electrochemical parameters of (PDDA/Hb)(8) films were estimated by square wave voltammetry, and the thickness of the PDDA/Hb bilayer was estimated by QCM and scanning electron microscopy. Trichloroacetic acid and nitrite (NO(2)(-)) were catalytically reduced at (PDDA/Hb)(8) film electrodes. The electrochemical catalytic reactions of O(2) and H(2)O(2) on (PDDA/Hb)(8) films were also studied.",
   "Light switching of molecules on surfaces.\nSmart surfaces, surfaces that respond to an external stimulus in a defined manner, hold considerable potential as components in molecular-based devices, not least as discrete switching elements. Many stimuli can be used to switch surfaces between different states, including redox, light, pH, and ion triggers. The present review focuses on molecular switching through the electronic excitation of molecules on surfaces with light. In developing light-responsive surfaces, investigators face several challenges, not only in achieving high photostationary states and fully reversible switching, but also in dealing with fatigue resistance and the effect of immobilization itself on molecular properties. The immobilization of light-responsive molecules requires the design and synthesis of functional molecular components both to achieve light switching and to anchor the molecular entity onto a surface. This review discusses several demonstrative examples of photoswitchable molecular systems in which the photochemistry has been explored in the immobilized state under ambient conditions and especially on electroactive surfaces, including self-assembled monolayers, bilayers, and polymer films.",
   "Preparation and characterization of biodegradable and electroactive polymer blend materials based on mPEG/tetraaniline and PLLA.\nA novel PGTA diblock copolymer containing electroactive TEA and mPEG is described. Biodegradable PLLA/PGTA polymer blends are shown to be electroactive. Nanopores of different sizes can be formed on the surface of the polymer blends. An MTT assay shows that the PLLA/PGTA blends exhibited reduced cytotoxicity as compared to TEA due to the introduction of the biocompatible PLLA moiety. Cell culture results show that the cells grow better when they were adhered to the surface of the PLLA/PGTA blends. The 80/20 wt.-% PLLA/PGTA blend shows the best biocompatibility and an electroactivity that accelerates the differentiation of rat C6 glioma cells.",
   "Hybrid Materials Based on Poly-3-amine-7-methylamine-2-methylphenazine and Magnetite Nanoparticles Immobilized on Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes.\nPolymer-metal-carbon hybrid nanomaterials based on thermostable electroactive poly-3-amine-7-methylamine-2-methylphenazine (PAMMP), single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT), and magnetite (Fe\u2083O\u2084) nanoparticles were synthesized for the first time. Hybrid Fe\u2083O\u2084/SWCNT/PAMMP nanomaterial synthesis was carried out via in situ chemical oxidative polymerization of 3-amine-7-methylamine-2-methylphenazine hydrochloride in the presence of metal-carbon Fe\u2083O\u2084/SWCNT nanocomposites. Fe\u2083O\u2084/SWCNT nanocomposites were obtained by the immobilization of magnetite nanoparticles on the SWCNT surface in the course of Fe\u2083O\u2084 nanoparticles synthesis in alkaline medium. The developed nanocomposite materials were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission (FE-SEM) scanning electron microscopy, atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and magnetometry. The chemical structure and phase composition, magnetic and electrical properties, and thermal stability of the obtained multifunctional nanomaterials, depending on synthesis conditions, were investigated.",
   "Integration of a zero dead-volume PDMS rotary switch valve in a miniaturised (bio)electroanalytical system.\nThis work features the design, fabrication and characterisation of a miniaturised electroanalytical lab on a chip that allows the performance of a complete bioassay, from the capture of magnetic particles through their functionalisation and sample incubation to the detection of electroactive reaction products. The system is built using mainly polymeric materials such as PMMA and PDMS and fast prototyping techniques such as milling and moulding. The system also includes a set of microelectrodes, photo-lithographed on a silicon chip. The novelty lies in the design of the rotary microvalve, which contains a microreactor so that various reaction and incubation steps can be carried out in isolation from the detection event with zero dead volume. This avoids contamination and fouling of the electrodes by proteins or other organic matter, and extends the useful lifetime of the detector. The system operation is demonstrated by a model example, consisting in the functionalisation of streptavidin-coated magnetic particles with biotinylated beta-galactosidase over periods ranging from 5 to 15 min, at which point the particles saturate. Although the system is intended for the development of enzyme-based electrochemical bioassays, the concept of its rotary microreactor can be applied more broadly.",
   "Controlled Aloin Release from Crosslinked Polyacrylamide Hydrogels: Effects of Mesh Size, Electric Field Strength and a Conductive Polymer.\nThe aim of this paper is to investigate the effects of hydrogel mesh size, a conductive polymer, and electric field strength on controlled drug delivery phenomena using drug-loaded polyacrylamide hydrogels prepared at various crosslinking ratios both with and without a conductive polymer system. Poly(p-phenylene vinylene), PPV, as the model conductive polymer, was used to study its ability to control aloin released from aloin-doped poly(p-phenylene vinylene)/polyacrylamide hydrogel (aloin-doped PPV/PAAM). In the passive release, the diffusion of aloin from five aloin-doped PPV/PAAM hydrogel systems each was delayed ranging from during the first three hours to during the first 14 h due to the ionic interaction between the anionic drug and PPV. After the delayed periods, aloin could diffuse continuously into the buffer solution through the PAAM matrix. The amount of aloin released from the aloin-doped PPV/PAAM rose with increasing electric field strength as a result of the three mechanisms: the expansion of PPV chains inside the hydrogel, iontophoresis, and the electroporation of the matrix pore size, combined. Furthermore, the conductive polymer and the electric field could be used in combination to regulate the amount of release drug to a desired level, to control the release rate, and to switch the drug delivery on/off.",
   "Regarding the origin of the delayed fluorescence of conjugated polymers.\nIn the first part of this work we revisit and reevaluate the experimental data that lead to the assignment of the origin of the delayed fluorescence (DF) to triplet-triplet annihilation for polyfluorene and to geminate pair recombination in the case of the ladder-type polyparaphenylene (MeLPPP); the ambiguity of this classification is unveiled. Next, new data about the DF of MeLPPP under applied electric field are presented. Here, the DF intensity completely recovers once the field is turned off, which rules out geminate pairs as the origin of the DF and in turn provides clear evidence of the triplet-triplet annihilation picture. Finally, we show and discuss how recombination of space charge layers may also give rise to electric field induced delayed fluorescence, whereby the formation of these space charge layers strongly depends on device configuration and purity of the materials.",
   "Contraction process of an electroactive actuator based on a one microsecond atomistic molecular dynamics simulation.\nThe contraction process of an electroactive actuator constituted by calix[4]arene units and quaterthiophene segments has been investigated at the microscopic level by using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in dichloromethane solution using explicit solvent molecules. Results derived from a 1 mus trajectory of the oxidized and deprotonated actuator indicate that the contraction occurs through a non-concerted mechanism in which each actuating units present in the system behave independently. The efficiency of the contraction process can be reduced by the presence of secondary conformational transitions in the calix[4]arene scaffolds. Accordingly, the drastic reduction of the molecular length expected during the contraction process can be limited by such transitions, which involve the rotational isomerism of a phenolate ring. However, such type of conformational transitions does not compromise the actuator power due to its intrinsic capacity to adopt compact molecular arrangements. On the other hand, the rate of the contraction process is influenced by the presence of solvent molecules, which have been found to reduce it by a factor of about 1000.",
   "Development of molecularly imprinted electrochemical sensor with reduced graphene oxide and titanium dioxide enhanced performance for the detection of toltrazuril in chicken muscle and egg.\nA molecularly imprinted electrochemical sensor for toltrazuril (TZR) detection based on molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) immobilized on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) modified platinum (Pt) electrode surface was fabricated for the first time. The synergistic fast electron transfer ability, large electroactive surface area and high catalytic activity from rGO and TiO2 contribute to amplify the electrochemical signal and consequently improve the sensitivity of the sensor. The cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were used to evaluate the performance of the electrochemical sensor. The results showed that the electrochemical sensor possessed high sensitivity, good selectivity and anti-interference ability toward TZR. By using the DPV, the electrochemical sensor displayed a wide linear concentration range from 0.43 to 42.54\u2009\u03bcg/L, with a limit of detection of 0.21\u2009\u03bcg/L (S/N\u2009=\u20093). Moreover, the recoveries and relative standard deviations (RSD) were 85.0%-97.0% and 3.5%-6.4% at three concentration levels, respectively, implying that the established sensor is promising for the accurate detection of TZR at trace levels in chicken muscle and egg samples.",
   "Conductive elastomer composites for fully polymeric, flexible bioelectronics.\nFlexible polymeric bioelectronics have the potential to address the limitations of metallic electrode arrays by minimizing the mechanical mismatch at the device-tissue interface for neuroprosthetic applications. This work demonstrates the straightforward fabrication of fully organic electrode arrays based on conductive elastomers (CEs) as a soft, flexible and stretchable electroactive composite material. CEs were designed as hybrids of polyurethane elastomers (PU) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), with the aim of combining the electrical properties of PEDOT:PSS with the mechanical compliance of elastomers. CE composites were fabricated by solvent casting of PEDOT:PSS dispersed in dissolved PU at different conductive polymer (CP) loadings, from 5 wt% to 25 wt%. The formation of PEDOT:PSS networks within the PU matrix and the resultant composite material properties were examined as a function of CP loading. Increased PEDOT:PSS loading was found to result in a more connected network within the PU matrix, resulting in increased conductivity and charge storage capacity. Increased CP loading was also determined to increase the Young's modulus and reduce the strain at failure. Biological assessment of CE composites showed them to mediate ReNcell VM human neural precursor cell adhesion. The increased stiffness of CE films was also found to promote neurite outgrowth. CE sheets were directly laser micromachined into a functional array and shown to deliver biphasic waveforms with comparable voltage transients to Pt arrays in in vitro testing.",
   "Phosphole-containing pi-conjugated systems: from model molecules to polymer films on electrodes.\nTwo series of 2,5-dipyridyl- and 2,5-dithienylphosphole derivatives containing sigma3- or sigma4-P atoms were prepared, and their optical (UV/Vis absorption, fluorescence spectra) and electrochemical properties were systematically evaluated. These physical properties depend mainly on the natures of the 2,5-substituents and of the phosphorus moiety, and they revealed that these compounds contain extended pi-conjugated systems. Structure-property relationships were established on the basis of these experimental data and ab initio calculations on the parent molecules. The limited aromatic character and low-lying LUMO of the phosphole ring appear to be crucial for achieving a highly delocalised pi system. Electrooxidation of 2,5-dithienylphosphole derivatives affords electroactive films with low optical band gaps. As observed for the corresponding monomers, the optical and electrochemical properties of the polymers can be varied over a wide range by modifying the nature of the phosphorus moiety.",
   "Electrochemical immunosensor for cholera toxin using liposomes and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-coated carbon nanotubes.\nA sensitive method for the detection of cholera toxin (CT) using an electrochemical immunosensor with liposomic magnification followed by adsorptive square-wave stripping voltammetry is described. Potassium ferrocyanide-encapsulated and ganglioside (GM1)-functionalized liposomes act as highly specific recognition labels for the amplified detection of cholera toxin. The sensing interface consists of monoclonal antibody against the B subunit of CT that is linked to poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) coated on Nafion-supported multiwalled carbon nanotube caste film on a glassy carbon electrode. The CT is detected by a \"sandwich-type\" assay on the electronic transducers, where the toxin is first bound to the anti-CT antibody and then to the GM1-functionalized liposome. The potassium ferrocyanide molecules are released from the bounded liposomes on the electrode by lyses with methanolic solution of Triton X-100. The released electroactive marker is measured by adsorptive square-wave stripping voltammetry. The sandwich assay provides the amplification route for the detection of the CT present in ultratrace levels. The calibration curve for CT had a linear range of 10(-14)-10(-7)g mL(-1). The detection limit of this immunosensor was 10(-16) g of cholera toxin (equivalent to 100 microL of 10(-15) g mL(-1)).",
   "PEDOT Coated Thick Film Electrodes for In Situ Detection of Cell Adhesion in Cell Cultures.\nLow temperature cofired ceramics (LTCC) provide a technology for the 3-dimensional integration of sensor arrays into bioreactors covering dimensions of several hundred micrometers. Since optical control in such assemblies is not possible, the in situ detection of cell adhesion on impedance electrodes with high spatial resolution would deliver crucial information. A current limitation is the increasing impedance of microelectrodes with decreasing diameter. This study evaluates the suitability of thick film gold electrodes, pristine and coated with electropolymerized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), for the detection of cell adhesion on the electrode surface. The impedance as criterion for cell attachment is measured with a recording system for electroactive cells with the aim of improving usability. Two cell cultures with different adhesion characteristic are used for adhesion assessment on planar test chips. The impedance increase measured on individual PEDOT coated electrodes due to tight contact of cells reaches a factor of 6.8 in cultures of well-adherent HepG2 cells. Less adhered NG108-15 cells produce a maximum impedance increase by a factor of 2.6. Since the electrode impedance is significantly reduced by PEDOT coating, a reduction of the electrode diameter to values below 100 \u00b5m and spatially resolved detection is possible. The results encourage further studies using PEDOT coated thick film electrodes as bio-electronic-interfaces. We presume that such miniaturized electrodes are suitable for 3-dimensional recordings in electroactive cell cultures, providing information of local cell adhesion at the same time.",
   "Potentiometric PVC membrane sensor for the determination of scopolamine in some pharmaceutical formulations.\nA novel PVC membrane electrode for the determination of scopolamine ion based on the formation of an ion-association complex of scopolamine with the phosphotungstate counter anion as an electroactive material dispersed in a PVC matrix is described. The sensor shows a fast, stable, near-Nenstian response for 1 x 10(-2) mol dm(-3) to 1 x 10(-6) mol dm(-3) scopolamine at 25 degrees C over the pH range of 3 - 7 with a cationic slope of 54.5 +/- 0.5 mV/decade. The lower detection limit is 8 x 10(-7) mol dm(-3) and the response time is 15 -45 s. The selectivity coefficients for scopolamine relative to the number of interfering substances were investigated. There was negligible interference from the studied cations, anions, and pharmaceutical excipients. The determination of scopolamine in aqueous solution shows an average recovery of 100.0% and a mean relative standard deviation (RSD) of 1.5% at 500 microg/cm3. The direct determination of scopolamine in some formulations (scopolamine injection and eye drops) gave results that compare favorably with those obtained by the United State of Pharmacopoeia method. Potentiometric titration of scopolamine with sodium tetraphenylborate and phosphotungstic acid as a titrant was monitored with the developed scopolamine electrode as an end point indicator electrode.",
   "An Innovative Strategy for the Fabrication of Functional Cell Sheets Using an Electroactive Conducting Polymer.\nHere, we report the development of an electric field-assisted methodology for constructing 3D C2C12 cell sheets with the potential for cell surface modification. In this method, a conducting polymer, polypyrrole (Ppy), is electrodeposited via biotin doping, and then chemical conjugation of biotinylated bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) is achieved using a biotin-streptavidin cross-linker. Subsequently, C2C12 cells are cultured on BMP2-immobilized Ppy surfaces to induce interactions between cell surface receptors and bound BMP2 ligands. Following these procedures, layers of BMP2-immobilized cells can be easily detached from the Ppy surface by applying an electrical potential. This novel method results in high affinity, ligand-bound cell sheets, which exhibit homogeneous coverage with membrane-bound proteins and signal activation that occurs via maximal receptor accessibility. Using this strategy to engineer the cell surface with desirable ligands results in structures that mimic in vivo tissues; thus, the method reported here has potential applications in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.",
   "Electrocatalytic reaction of hydrogen peroxide and NADH based on poly(neutral red) and FAD hybrid film.\nA simple method to immobilize poly(neutral red) (PNR) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) hybrid film (PNR/FAD) by cyclic voltammetry is proposed. The PNR/FAD hybrid film can be easily prepared on an electrode surface involving electropolymerization of neutral red (NR) monomers and the electrostatic interaction between the positively charged PNR and the negatively charged FAD. It exhibits electroactive, stable, surface-confined, pH-dependent, nano-sized, and compatible properties. It provides good electrocatalytic properties to various species. It shows a sensitivity of 5.4 \u03bcA mM(-1) cm(-2) and 21.5 \u03bcA mM(-1) cm(-2) for hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) with the linear range of 0.1 \u03bcM-39 mM and 5 \u00d7 10(-5) to 2.5 \u00d7 10(-4) M, respectively. It shows another linear range of 48.8-355.5 mM with the sensitivity of 12.3 \u03bcA mM(-1) cm(-2) for H(2)O(2). In particular, the PNR/FAD hybrid film has potential to replace some hemoproteins to be a cathode of biofuel cells and provide the biosensing system for glucose and ethanol.",
   "Reversibly Assembled Electroconductive Hydrogel via a Host-Guest Interaction for 3D Cell Culture.\nThe study of cells responding to an electroconductive environment is impeded by the lack of a method, which would allow the encapsulation of cells in an extracellular matrix-like 3D electroactive matrix, and more challengingly, permit a simple mechanism to release cells for further characterization. Herein, we report a polysaccharide-based conductive hydrogel system formed via a \u03b2-cyclodextrin-adamantane host-guest interaction. Oxidative polymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) in the presence of adamantyl-modified sulfated alginate (S-Alg-Ad) results in bio-electroconductive polymer PEDOT:S-Alg-Ad, which can form hydrogel with poly-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (P\u03b2-CD). The PEDOT:S-Alg-Ad/P\u03b2-CD hydrogels can be tuned on aspects of mechanical and electrical properties, exhibit self-healing feature, and are injectable. Electron microscopy suggested that the difference in stiffness and conductivity is associated with the nacre-like layered nanostructures when different sizes of PEDOT:S-Alg-Ad nanoparticles were used. Myoblast C2C12 cells were encapsulated in the conductive hydrogel and exhibited proliferation rate comparable to that in nonconductive S-Alg-Ad/P\u03b2-CD hydrogel. The cells could be released from the hydrogels by adding the \u03b2-CD monomer. Astonishingly, the conductive hydrogel can dramatically promote myotube-like structure formation, which is not in the non-electroconductive hydrogel. The ability to embed and release cells in an electroconductive environment will open new doors for cell culture and tissue engineering.",
   "The intrinsic redox reactions of polyamic acid derivatives and their application in hydrogen peroxide sensor.\nPolyamic acids (PAAs) containing benzothiazole (BT) and benzoxazole (BO) pendent groups (PAA-BT and PAA-BO, respectively) which possessed electroactivity were synthesized successfully. The addition of H(2)O(2) chemically oxidized the intrinsic carboxylic acid groups of PAA to form peroxy acid groups, and the peroxy acid further oxidized the electroactive sites of BT and BO to form N-oxides. The N-oxides could be reverted to their original form by electrochemical reduction, thus increasing the electrochemical reductive current. Based on this mechanism, enzyme-free hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) biosensors were prepared by modifying gold electrodes with the PAA derivatives (PAA-BT/Au and PAA-BO/Au, respectively). These biosensors had rapid response times (3.9-5.2 s) and high selectivity and sensitivity (280.6-311.2 \u03bcA/mM-cm(2)). A comparison of the PAA-BT/Au and PAA-BO/Au electrodes with electrodes prepared using polyamide-BT or polyamide-BO (i.e., lacking the carboxylic acid groups) confirmed the mechanism by which PAA derivatives detect H(2)O(2). Modifying the surface morphology of the electrode from a planar to a three-dimensional (3D) configuration enhanced the performance of the PAA-BO/Au electrode. The sensitivity of the 3D-PAA-BO/Au electrode was 1394.9 \u03bcA/mM-cm(2), \u223c 4.5 times higher than that of the planar electrode. The detection limit was also enhanced from 5.0 to 1.43 \u03bcM. The biosensor was used analytically to detect and measure H(2)O(2) in urine samples collected from healthy individuals and patients suffering from noninvasive bladder cancer. The results were promising and comparable to that measured by a classical HPLC method, which verified the developed biosensor had a potential to provide a usefully analytical approach for bladder cancer.",
   "Direct Mechanical Stimulation of Stem Cells: A Beating Electromechanically Active Scaffold for Cardiac Tissue Engineering.\nThe combination of stem cell therapy with a supportive scaffold is a promising approach to improving cardiac tissue engineering. Stem cell therapy can be used to repair nonfunctioning heart tissue and achieve myocardial regeneration, and scaffold materials can be utilized in order to successfully deliver and support stem cells in vivo. Current research describes passive scaffold materials; here an electroactive scaffold that provides electrical, mechanical, and topographical cues to induced human pluripotent stem cells (iPS) is presented. The poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) fiber scaffold coated with conductive polymer polypyrrole (PPy) is capable of delivering direct electrical and mechanical stimulation to the iPS. The electroactive scaffolds demonstrate no cytotoxic effects on the iPS as well as an increased expression of cardiac markers for both stimulated and unstimulated protocols. This study demonstrates the first application of PPy as a supportive electroactive material for iPS and the first development of a fiber scaffold capable of dynamic mechanical actuation.",
   "Site-specific installation and study of electroactive units in every layer of dendrons.\nWhereas encapsulation of functional groups at the core of dendrimers is well-understood, very little is known about their intermediate layers or even the periphery. Here we report on a systematic investigation of every layer of dendrimers by incorporating a single ferrocene unit in well-defined locations in dendrons. Site-specific incorporation of the ferrocene unit was achieved by utilizing the dendrimer sequencing methodology. We show here that the redox potential values of ferrocene at intermediate layers were remarkably different from those at the core and the periphery. Although redox potential values were location-dependent, no significant change in the rate of heterogeneous electron transfer (k(0)) was observed with respect to locations. This was attributed to the possibility that free rotation of dendrimer nullifies the distance between the electrode and ferrocene unit. Finally, we also show that no Faradaic current was observed for the amphiphilic assemblies of these dendrons, whereas the same dendron did exhibit significant Faradaic current in nonassembling solvent environments.",
   "Contributions by a novel edge effect to the permselectivity of an electrosynthesized polymer for microbiosensor applications.\nPt electrodes of different sizes (2 x 10(-5)-2 x 10(-2) cm(2)) and geometries (disks and cylinders) were coated with the ultrathin non-conducting form of poly(o-phenylenediamine), PPD, using amperometric electrosynthesis. Analysis of the ascorbic acid (AA) and H(2)O(2) apparent permeabilities for these Pt/PPD sensors revealed that the PPD deposited near the electrode insulation (Teflon or glass edge) was not as effective as the bulk surface PPD for blocking AA access to the Pt substrate. This discovery impacts on the design of implantable biosensors where electrodeposited polymers, such as PPD, are commonly used as the permselective barrier to block electroactive interference by reducing agents present in the target medium. The undesirable \"edge effect\" was particularly marked for small disk electrodes which have a high edge density (ratio of PPD-insulation edge length to electrode area), but was essentially absent for cylinder electrodes with a length of >0.2 mm. Sample biosensors, with a configuration based on these findings (25 microm diameter Pt fiber cylinders) and designed for brain neurotransmitter L-glutamate, behaved well in vitro in terms of Glu sensitivity and AA blocking.",
   "Nanometric thin polymeric films based on molecularly imprinted technology: towards electrochemical sensing applications.\nA new approach for assembling selective electrodes based on molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) is presented. The approach is based on the radical polymerization of a mixture of methacrylic acid (MAA) and ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) in the presence of an initiator, benzoyl peroxide (BPO) and an activator, N,N'-dimethyl-p-toluidine (DMpT) at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. To form nanometric thin polymeric films the polymerization solution was spin-coated in the course of polymerization. The different physical and chemical parameters that affected the properties of the films, such as the spinning rate and the EGDMA:MAA ratio, were studied and optimized. A variety of techniques, e.g., rheoscopy, SEM, AFM, profilometry and electrochemistry, were used to characterize the films and the polymerization process. By optimizing the conditions very thin and reproducible films could be prepared and imprinted. The electrochemical behavior of the films showed that they were permeable to water-soluble electroactive species providing that either polyethylene glycol or template species were added to the polymerization mixture. Finally, we demonstrated that films imprinted with ferrocenylmethyl alcohol (Fc-MeOH) successfully extracted the imprinted species after their removal from MIPs.",
   "Cluster synthesis of monodisperse rutile-TiO2 nanoparticles and dielectric TiO2-vinylidene fluoride oligomer nanocomposites.\nThe embedding of oxide nanoparticles in polymer matrices produces a greatly enhanced dielectric response by combining the high dielectric strength and low loss of suitable host polymers with the high electric polarizability of nanoparticles. The fabrication of oxide-polymer nanocomposites with well-controlled distributions of nanoparticles is, however, challenging due to the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers between the polymer matrix and nanoparticle fillers. In the present study, monodisperse TiO(2) nanoparticles having an average particle size of 14.4\u00a0nm and predominant rutile phase were produced using a cluster-deposition technique without high-temperature thermal annealing and subsequently coated with uniform vinylidene fluoride oligomer (VDFO) molecules using a thermal evaporation source, prior to deposition as TiO(2)-VDFO nanocomposite films on suitable substrates. The molecular coatings on TiO(2) nanoparticles serve two purposes, namely to prevent the TiO(2) nanoparticles from contacting each other and to couple the nanoparticle polarization to the matrix. Parallel-plate capacitors made of TiO(2)-VDFO nanocomposite film as the dielectric exhibit minimum dielectric dispersion and low dielectric loss. Dielectric measurements also show an enhanced effective dielectric constant in TiO(2)-VDFO nanocomposites as compared to that of pure VDFO. This study demonstrates for the first time a unique electroactive particle coating in the form of a ferroelectric VDFO that has high-temperature stability as compared to conventionally used polymers for fabricating dielectric oxide-polymer nanocomposites.",
   "Polymeric Redox-Active Electrodes for Sodium-Ion Batteries.\nPolymer binding agents are critical for the good performance of the electrodes of Na- and Li-ion batteries during cycling as they hold the electroactive material together to form a cohesive assembly because of their mechanical and chemical stability as well as adhesion to the current collector. New redox-active polymer binders that insert Na+ ions and show adhesion properties were synthesized by adding polyether amine blocks (Jeffamine) based on mixed propylene oxide and ethylene oxide blocks to p-phenylenediamine and terephthalaldehyde units to form electroactive Schiff-base groups along the macromolecule. The synthetic parameters and the electrochemical properties of these terpolymers as Na-ion negative electrodes in half cells were studied. Reversible capacities of 300\u2005mAh\u2009g-1 (50\u2005wt\u2009% conducting carbon) and 200\u2005mAh\u2009g-1 (20\u2005wt\u2009% conducting carbon) were achieved in powder and Cu-supported electrodes, respectively, for a polySchiff-polyether terpolymer synthesized by using a poly(ethylene oxide) block of 600\u2005g\u2009mol-1 in place of one third of the aniline units. The new redox-active polymers were also used as a binding agent of another anode material (hard carbon), which led to an increase of the total capacity of the electrode compared to that prepared with other standard fluorinated polymer binders such as poly(vinylidene) fluoride.",
   "Chitin degradation and electricity generation by Aeromonas hydrophila in microbial fuel cells.\nChitin is one of the most abundant biopolymers in nature and the main composition of shrimp and crab shells (usually as food wastes). Thus it is essential to investigate the potential of degrading chitin for energy recovery. This study investigated the anaerobic degradation of chitin by Aeromonas hydrophila, a chitinolytic and popular electroactive bacterium, in both fermentation and microbial fuel cell (MFC) systems. The primary chitin metabolites produced in MFC were succinate, lactate, acetate, formate, and ethanol. The total metabolite concentration from chitin degradation increased seven-fold in MFC compared to the fermentation system, as well as additional electricity generation. Moreover, A.\u00a0hydrophila degraded GlcNAc (the intermediate of chitin hydrolysis) significantly faster (0.97 and 0.94\u00a0mM\u00a0C/d/mM-GlcNAc) than chitin (0.13 and 0.03\u00a0mM\u00a0C/d/mM-GlcNAc) in MFC and fermentation systems, indicating that extracellular hydrolysis of chitin was the rate-limiting step and this step could be accelerated in MFC. Furthermore, more chemicals produced by the addition of exogenous mediators in MFC. This study proves that the chitin could be degraded effectively by an electroactive bacterium in MFC, and our results suggest that this bioelectrochemical system might be useful for the degradation of recalcitrant biomass to recover energy.",
   "Biopolymer-Inspired N-Doped Nanocarbon Using Carbonized Polydopamine: A High-Performance Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen-Evolution Reaction.\nHydrogen-evolution reaction (HER) is a promising technology for renewable energy conversion and storage. Electrochemical HER can provide a cost-effective method for the clean production of hydrogen. In this study, a biomimetic eco-friendly approach to fabricate nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets, exhibiting a high HER performance, and using a carbonized polydopamine (C-PDA), is described. As a biopolymer, polydopamine (PDA) exhibits high biocompatibility and can be easily obtained by an environmentally benign green synthesis with dopamine. Inspired by the polymerization of dopamine, we have devised the facile synthesis of nitrogen-doped nanocarbons using a carbonized polydopamine for the HER in acidic media. The N-doped nanocarbons exhibit excellent performance for H2 generation. The required overpotential at 5 mA/cm2 is 130 mV, and the Tafel slope is 45 mV/decade. Experimental characterizations confirm that the excellent performance of the N-doped nanocarbons can be attributed to the multisite nitrogen doping, while theoretical computations indicate the promotion effect of tertiary/aromatic nitrogen doping in enhancing the spin density of the doped samples and consequently in forming highly electroactive sites for HER applications.",
   "Label-free and reagentless electrochemical detection of microRNAs using a conducting polymer nanostructured by carbon nanotubes: application to prostate cancer biomarker miR-141.\nIn this paper, a label-free and reagentless microRNA sensor based on an interpenetrated network of carbon nanotubes and electroactive polymer is described. The nanostructured polymer film presents very well-defined electroactivity in neutral aqueous medium in the cathodic potential domain from the quinone group embedded in the polymer backbone. Addition of microRNA miR-141 target (prostate cancer biomarker) gives a \"signal-on\" response, i.e. a current increase due to enhancement of the polymer electroactivity. On the contrary, non-complementary miRNAs such as miR-103 and miR-29b-1 do not lead to any significant current change. A very low detection limit of ca. 8 fM is achieved with this sensor.",
   "Rational design and application of molecularly imprinted sol-gel polymer for the electrochemically selective and sensitive determination of Sudan I.\nAn electrochemical strategy on the basis of rationally designed molecularly imprinted sol-gel polymer embedded with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) is developed for the specific and sensitive determination of Sudan I. The rationally designed sensing Sudan I imprinted sol-gel was prepared by mixing Sudan I with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, tetraethoxysilane, chitosan, and AuNPs, followed by copolymerization and extraction of the template molecules. The hybrid forming membrane was characterized by SEM and FTIR-ATR, and used for the linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) determination of Sudan I in water/ethanol solutions. The LSV responses exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity, as discriminated from Sudan I analogues. Under optimal experimental conditions, LSV peak currents were linearly proportional to the concentrations of Sudan I in the range from 0.1 \u00d7 10(-7) to 1.0 \u00d7 10(-5)M, with a detection limit of 2.0 \u00d7 10(-9)M. The strategy is generally applicable in developing sensitive, selective, and moreover, reusable electrochemical sensors for quantitative determination of electroactive species.",
   "Mechanics and Energetics of Electromembranes.\nThe recent discovery of electroactive polymers has shown great promises in the field of soft robotics and was logically followed by experimental, numerical, and theoretical developments. Most of these studies were concerned with systems entirely covered by electrodes. However, there is a growing interest for partially active polymers, in which the electrode covers only one part of the membrane. Indeed, such actuation can trigger buckling instabilities and so represents a route toward the control of three-dimensional shapes. Here, we study theoretically the behavior of such partially active electroactive polymer. We address two problems: (1) the electrostatic elastica including geometric nonlinearities and partially electroactive strip using a variational approach. We propose a new interpretation of the equations of deformation, by drawing analogies with biological growth, in which the effect of the electric voltage is seen as a change in the reference stress-free state. (2) We explain the nature of the distribution of electrostatic forces on this simple system, which is not trivial. In particular, we find that edge effects are playing a major role in this problem.",
   "Molecularly Imprinted Electropolymer for a Hexameric Heme Protein with Direct Electron Transfer and Peroxide Electrocatalysis.\nFor the first time a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) with direct electron transfer (DET) and bioelectrocatalytic activity of the target protein is presented. Thin films of MIPs for the recognition of a hexameric tyrosine-coordinated heme protein (HTHP) have been prepared by electropolymerization of scopoletin after oriented assembly of HTHP on a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) on gold electrodes. Cavities which should resemble the shape and size of HTHP were formed by template removal. Rebinding of the target protein sums up the recognition by non-covalent interactions between the protein and the MIP with the electrostatic attraction of the protein by the SAM. HTHP bound to the MIP exhibits quasi-reversible DET which is reflected by a pair of well pronounced redox peaks in the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) with a formal potential of -184.4 \u00b1 13.7 mV vs. Ag/AgCl (1 M KCl) at pH 8.0 and it was able to catalyze the cathodic reduction of peroxide. At saturation the MIP films show a 12-fold higher electroactive surface concentration of HTHP than the non-imprinted polymer (NIP).",
   "Preparation and characterization of thick-film Ni/MH battery.\nUsing the porous polypropylene (PP) films sputtered with gold and the Ni as current collectors, the electroactive materials (Ni(OH)2 and metal hydride (MH)) of positive and negative electrodes were prepared on the current collector using thick-film technology. Two types of cell configurations were prepared and the characteristics of these batteries were compared. The cycle number for the formation of batteries based on the porous PP film was found to be 2, which was significantly less than that of batteries based on the ceramic substrates. Using the porous PP film as substrate, the number of cycles for the formation of battery increased from 2 to 5 with the increase of the charge/discharge rate from 0.1C/0.025C to 2.0C/0.5C. The silver oxides dendrites formed by the oxidation of silver paste used to adhere the current collectors and the conducting wires in the charge/discharge process caused a short contact between the positive and negative electrodes, which then caused the battery failure. The cycle life of the battery based on the porous PP film was found to be greater than 400 when the charge/discharge rate was 2.0C/0.5C.",
   "Polymeric materials as artificial muscles: an overview.\nThe accurate selection of materials and the fine tuning of their properties represent a fundamental aspect in the realization of new active systems able to produce actuating forces, such as artificial muscles. In this regard, exciting opportunities for the design of new advanced systems are offered by materials belonging to the emerging class of functional polymers: exploiting their actuation response, specific devices can be realized. Along this direction, materials showing either shape-memory effect (SME) or shape-change effect (SCE) have been the subject of extensive studies aimed at designing of actuators as artificial muscles. Here, we concisely review active polymers in terms of properties and main applications in artificial muscle design.",
   "Enhanced bioelectricity generation and azo dye treatment in a reversible photo-bioelectrochemical cell by using novel anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS)/MnOx-doped polypyrrole film electrodes.\nA novel anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate/MnOx-doped polypyrrole film (AQDS/Mn/PPy) electrode was prepared by one-step electropolymerization method and was used to improve performance of a reversible photo-bioelectrochemical cell (RPBEC). The RPBEC was operated in polarity reversion depended on dark/light reaction of alga Chlorella vulgaris by which sequential decolorization of azo dye and mineralization of decolorization products coupled with bioelectricity generation can be achieved. The results showed that formation of uniform AQDS/Mn/PPy film significantly enhanced electroactive surface area and electrocatalytic activity of carbon electrode. The RPBEC with AQDS/Mn/PPy electrodes demonstrated 77% increases in maximum power and 73% increases in Congo red decolorization rate before polarity reversion, and 198% increases in maximum power and 138% increases in decolorization products mineralization rate after polarity reversion, respectively, compared to the RPBEC with bare electrode. This was resulted from simultaneous dynamics improvement in half-reaction rate of anode and photo-biocathode due to enhanced electron transfer and algal-bacterial biofilm formation.",
   "Electroactive metal-organic framework composites: Design and biosensing application.\nMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as molecular crystalline materials have been extensively applied in various fields such as catalysis, separation, and biomedical engineering. However, the applications of MOFs materials are limited in electrochemical biosensing due to the poor conductivity, less selectivity, and lack of modification sites. By incorporating the functionalized nanoparticles into MOF structures, MOF-based composites are endowed with high electronic conductivity and strong catalytic activity, which process the advantages over single-component MOFs. With a particular focus on the electrochemical applications of MOF composites, this review summarizes the comprehensive guidelines on design of electroactive MOF composites: dopant modification of electroactive ligands, in situ synthesis of nanoparticle@MOF composites and post-modification of MOF structure. The illustrative examples of electroactive MOF composites in the last five years are highlighted in electrochemical, electrochemiluminescent, and photoelectrochemical biosensing. The prospects and challenges for future work are also included. Understanding the structure-function relationship of electroactive MOF composites benefits the design of next-generation electrochemical biosensors.",
   "Functional Aromatic Polyamides.\nWe describe herein the state of the art following the last 8 years of research into aromatic polyamides, wholly aromatic polyamides or aramids. These polymers belong to the family of high performance materials because of their exceptional thermal and mechanical behavior. Commercially, they have been transformed into fibers mainly for production of advanced composites, paper, and cut and fire protective garments. Huge research efforts have been carried out to take advantage of the mentioned characteristics in advanced fields related to transport applications, optically active materials, electroactive materials, smart materials, or materials with even better mechanical and thermal behavior.",
   "Optical switching of protein interactions on photosensitive-electroactive polymers measured by atomic force microscopy.\nThe ability to switch the physico-chemical properties of conducting polymers opens up new possibilities for a range of applications. Appropriately functionalised materials can provide routes to multi-modal switching, for example, in response to light and/or electrochemical stimuli. This capability is important in the field of bionics wherein remote and temporal control of the properties of materials is becoming attractive. The ability to actuate a film via photonic stimuli is particularly interesting as it facilitates the modulation of interactions between host binding sites and potential guest molecules. In this work, we studied two different poly-terthiophenes: one was functionalised with a spiropyran photoswitch (pTTh-SP) and the second with a non-photoswitchable methyl acetate moiety (pTTh-MA). These substrates were exposed to several cycles of illumination with light of different wavelengths and the resulting effect studied with UV-vis spectroscopy, contact angle and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM tips were chemically activated with fibronectin (FN) and the adhesion force of the protein to the polymeric surface was measured. The pTTh-MA (no SP incorporated) showed a slightly higher average maximum adhesion (0.96 \u00b1 0.14 nN) than the modified pTTh-SP surface (0.77 \u00b1 0.08 nN), but after exposure of the pTTh-SP polymer to UV, the average maximum adhesion of the pTTh-MC (merocyanine form) was significantly smaller (0.49 \u00b1 0.06 nN) than both the pTTh-MA and pTTh-SP. In addition, the tip-sample separation distances of the adhesive interactions are indicative of the FN interaction occurring over a distance more closely related to the average dimensions of its compact conformation. The results suggest that surface energy and hydrophobic forces are predominant in determining the protein adhesion to the films studied and that this effect can be photonically tuned. By extension, this further implies that it should be possible to obtain a degree of spatial and temporal control of the surface binding behaviour of certain proteins with these functionalised surfaces through photo-activation/deactivation, which, in principle, should facilitate patterned growth behaviour (e.g. using masks or directional illumination) or photocontrol of protein uptake and release.",
   "Modulation of direct electron transfer of cytochrome c by use of a molecularly imprinted thin film.\nWe describe the preparation of a molecularly imprinted polymer film (MIP) on top of a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) on gold, where the template cytochrome c (cyt c) participates in direct electron transfer (DET) with the underlying electrode. To enable DET, a non-conductive polymer film is electrodeposited from an aqueous solution of scopoletin and cyt c on to the surface of a gold electrode previously modified with MUA. The electroactive surface concentration of cyt c was 0.5 pmol cm(-2). In the absence of the MUA layer, no cyt c DET was observed and the pseudo-peroxidatic activity of the scopoletin-entrapped protein, assessed via oxidation of Ampliflu red in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, was only 30% of that for the MIP on MUA. This result indicates that electrostatic adsorption of cyt c by the MUA-SAM substantially increases the surface concentration of cyt c during the electrodeposition step, and is a prerequisite for the productive orientation required for DET. After template removal by treatment with sulfuric acid, rebinding of cyt c to the MUA-MIP-modified electrode occurred with an affinity constant of 100,000 mol(-1) L, a value three times higher than that determined by use of fluorescence titration for the interaction between scopoletin and cyt c in solution. The DET of cyt c in the presence of myoglobin, lysozyme, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) reveals that the MIP layer suppresses the effect of competing proteins.",
   "Control of neural stem cell survival by electroactive polymer substrates.\nStem cell function is regulated by intrinsic as well as microenvironmental factors, including chemical and mechanical signals. Conducting polymer-based cell culture substrates provide a powerful tool to control both chemical and physical stimuli sensed by stem cells. Here we show that polypyrrole (PPy), a commonly used conducting polymer, can be tailored to modulate survival and maintenance of rat fetal neural stem cells (NSCs). NSCs cultured on PPy substrates containing different counter ions, dodecylbenzenesulfonate (DBS), tosylate (TsO), perchlorate (ClO(4)) and chloride (Cl), showed a distinct correlation between PPy counter ion and cell viability. Specifically, NSC viability was high on PPy(DBS) but low on PPy containing TsO, ClO(4) and Cl. On PPy(DBS), NSC proliferation and differentiation was comparable to standard NSC culture on tissue culture polystyrene. Electrical reduction of PPy(DBS) created a switch for neural stem cell viability, with widespread cell death upon polymer reduction. Coating the PPy(DBS) films with a gel layer composed of a basement membrane matrix efficiently prevented loss of cell viability upon polymer reduction. Here we have defined conditions for the biocompatibility of PPy substrates with NSC culture, critical for the development of devices based on conducting polymers interfacing with NSCs.",
   "An amperometric glucose biosensor based on poly(o-aminophenol) and Prussian blue films at platinum electrode.\nPrussian blue (PB), as a good catalyst for the reduction of hydrogen peroxide, has been combined with nonconducting poly(o-aminophenol) (POAP) film to assemble glucose biosensor. Compared with PB-modified enzymatic biosensor, the biosensor based on glucose oxidase immobilized in POAP film at PB-modified electrode shows much improved stability (78% remains after 30 days) in neutral medium. Additionally, the biosensor, at an applied potential of 0.0 V, exhibits other good characteristics, such as relative low detection limit (0.01 mM), short response time (within 5s), large current density (0.28 mA/cm2), high sensitivity (24 mAM(-1)cm(-2)), and good antiinterferent ability. The apparent activation energy of enzyme-catalyzed reaction and apparent Michaelis-Menten constant are 34.2 KJmol(-1) and 10.5 mM, respectively. In addition, effects of temperature, applied potential used in the determination, pH value of the detection solution, and electroactive interferents on the amperometric response of the sensor were investigated and are discussed.",
   "Electropolymerization of pyrrole and immobilization of glucose oxidase in a flow system: influence of the operating conditions on analytical performance.\nThe in situ potentiostatic electropolymerization of pyrrole (Py) on a Pt electrode in a thin-layer amperometric cell and the entrapment of the enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) for the determination of glucose are reported. Polypyrrole (PPy) is directly formed by continuous passage of a buffered solution of the monomer (0.4 M) and enzyme (250 U mL-1) at pH 7 at a flow rate of 0.05-0.1 mL min-1 under a constant applied potential of +0.85 V vs Ag/AgCl decreases. The electrosynthesis of PPy by injection of 500 microL of a Py + GOx solution in a carrier electrolyte consisting of 0.05 M phosphate buffer and 0.1 M KCl at pH 7.0 was also assayed. The influence of the electropolymerization conditions on the analytical response of the sensor to glucose was investigated. The analytical performance of the PPy/GOx sensor was also studied in terms of durability and storage life, as well as selectivity against electroactive species such as ascorbic acid and uric acid as a function of the thickness of the polymer film formed.",
   "Scalable Synthesis and Multi-Electron Transfer of Aniline/Fluorene Copolymer for Solution-Processable Battery Cathodes.\nIn this study, the authors report the highly efficient, multigram-scale synthesis of an ester-functionalized, poly(aniline-co-fluorene) polymer. The excellent solubility and film-forming ability of this polymer facilitate its application as a reversible battery cathode. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring confirms a multi-electron transfer process, resulting in a specific discharge capacity of 51 mAh g-1 and a high reversible doping level of 0.69. Galvanostatic cycling at 1 C demonstrates excellent electrode stability with a capacity retention of 95.2% after 100 cycles. Therefore, this work demonstrates a novel electroactive polymer that exemplifies how chemical functionality may be used to properly balance processability and electroactivity of macromolecular battery cathodes.",
   "Imprinted polymer-based sensor system for herbicides using differential-pulse voltammetry on screen-printed electrodes.\nA sensor system for the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxy-acetic acid has been developed based on specific recognition of the analyte by a molecularly imprinted polymer and electrochemical detection using disposable screen-printed electrodes. The method involves a competitive binding step with a nonrelated electrochemically active probe. For batch binding assays, imprinted polymer particles are incubated in suspension with the analyte and the probe, followed by centrifugation and quantification of the unbound probe in the supernatant. Two different compounds, namely 2,4-dichlorophenol and homogentisic acid, were tested as potential electroactive probes. Both compounds could be conveniently detected by differential-pulse voltammetry on screen-printed, solvent-resistant three-electrode systems having carbon working electrodes. Whereas 2,4-dichlorophenol showed very high nonspecific binding to the polymer, homogentisic acid bound specifically to the imprinted sites and thus allowed calibration curves for the analyte in the micromolar range to be recorded. An integrated sensor was developed by coating the imprinted polymer particles directly onto the working electrode. Following incubation of the modified electrode in a solution containing the analyte and the probe, the bound fraction of the probe is quantified. This system provides a cheap, disposable sensor for rapid determination of environmentally relevant and other analytes.",
   "Tissue engineering of electrically responsive tissues using polyaniline based polymers: a review.\nConducting polymers have found numerous applications as biomaterial components serving to effectively deliver electrical signals from an external source to the seeded cells. Several cell types including cardiomyocytes, neurons, and osteoblasts respond to electrical signals by improving their functional outcomes. Although a wide variety of conducting polymers are available, polyaniline (PANI) has emerged as a popular choice due to its attractive properties such as ease of synthesis, tunable conductivity, environmental stability, and biocompatibility. PANI in its pure form has exhibited biocompatibility both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, and has been combined with a host of biodegradable polymers to form composites having a range of mechanical, electrical, and surface properties. Moreover, recent studies in literature report on the functionalization of polyaniline oligomers with end segments that make it biodegradable and improve its biocompatibility, two properties which make these materials highly desirable for applications in tissue engineering. This review will discuss the features and properties of PANI based composites that make them effective biomaterials, and it provides a comprehensive summary of studies where the use of PANI as a biomaterial component has enhanced cellular function and behavior. We also discuss recent studies utilizing functionalized PANI oligomers, and conclude that electroactive PANI and its derivatives show great promise in eliciting favorable responses from various cell lines that respond to electrical stimuli, and are therefore effective biomaterials for the engineering of electrically responsive biological tissues and organs.",
   "Efficient Capture and Isolation of Tumor-Related Circulating Cell-Free DNA from Cancer Patients Using Electroactive Conducting Polymer Nanowire Platforms.\nCirculating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is currently recognized as a key non-invasive biomarker for cancer diagnosis and progression and therapeutic efficacy monitoring. Because cfDNA has been detected in patients with diverse types of cancers, the use of efficient strategies to isolate cfDNA not only provides valuable insights into tumour biology, but also offers the potential for developing new cancer-specific targets. However, the challenges associated with conventional cfDNA extraction methods prevent their further clinical applications. Here, we developed a nanostructured conductive polymer platform for the efficient capture and release of circulating cfDNA and demonstrated its potential clinical utility using unprocessed plasma samples from patients with breast and lung cancers. Our results confirmed that the platform's enhanced efficiency allows tumor-specific circulating cfDNA to be recovered at high yield and purity.",
   "A highly sensitive molecular structural probe applied to in situ biosensing of metabolites using PEDOT:PSS.\nA large amount of research within organic biosensors is dominated by organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) that use conducting polymers such as poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). Despite the recent advances in OECT-based biosensors, the sensing is solely reliant on the amperometric detection of the bioanalytes. This is typically accompanied by large undesirable parasitic electrical signals from the electroactive components in the electrolyte. Herein, we present the use of in situ resonance Raman spectroscopy to probe subtle molecular structural changes of PEDOT:PSS associated with its doping level. We demonstrate how such doping level changes of PEDOT:PSS can be used, for the first time, on operational OECTs for sensitive and selective metabolite sensing while simultaneously performing amperometric detection of the analyte. We test the sensitivity by molecularly sensing a lowest glucose concentration of 0.02\u2009mM in phosphate-buffered saline solution. By changing the electrolyte to cell culture media, the selectivity of in situ resonance Raman spectroscopy is emphasized as it remains unaffected by other electroactive components in the electrolyte. The application of this molecular structural probe highlights the importance of developing biosensing probes that benefit from high sensitivity of the material's structural and electrical properties while being complimentary with the electronic methods of detection.",
   "Ferrocene-coated CdSe/ZnS quantum dots as electroactive nanoparticles hybrids.\nElectrochemical properties of core-shell CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) in a non-aqueous solution are presented. Cathodic reduction and anodic oxidation processes involving the QD HOMO and LUMO levels as well as defect states were identified by cyclic voltammetry. The electrochemical bandgap was estimated from the anodic and cathodic redox peaks and found to match well with the optical bandgap estimated from the absorption spectrum. The trioctylphosphine oxide ligands on the surface of the QDs were exchanged to electroactive ferrocenyl thiols and the resulting material was characterized by NMR and optical spectroscopy. Cyclic voltammetry showed that the redox potentials of the QDs are modified due to the presence of ferrocene on the surface of the QD. The QD oxidation peak decreased and the reduction peak shifted to more negative potentials. The concurrent shift of the ferrocene redox peaks indicates that the system displays features of a 'molecular hybrid', where both the QD and the ligand influence each other.",
   "Mediator-free amperometric glucose biosensor based on glucose oxidase entrapped in poly(vinyl alcohol) matrix.\nA simple and novel amperometric biosensor for glucose detection is proposed. It is based on the immobilization of glucose oxidase (GOx) in a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrix directly drop casted on a platinum electrode surface (Pt/GOx-PVA). Glucose was determined in the absence of a mediator used to transfer electrons between the electrode and the enzyme. The correlation between peak current (i(p)) and scan rate has been verified and the effect of pH solution has been checked. Glucose detection has been performed amperometrically at -400 mV by using pulsed amperometric detection (PAD). Under the selected optimal conditions, the biosensor showed low detection limit (10 \u03bcM), wide dynamic range (0.1-37 mM) and high sensitivity. The biosensor amperometric response revealed it to be specific to glucose without significant interference from other sugars and electroactive species coexisting with glucose in biological fluids. Response stability was another interesting feature of the developed system as it was almost completely recovered when the biosensor was left in opportune storage conditions (i.e., a response decrease of only 13% after 35 days in air at room temperature). Finally, X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) characterization revealed a homogeneous film deposited on the Pt substrate whose structure is also preserved under operative conditions.",
   "Alternated quinoid/aromatic units in terthiophenes building blocks for electroactive narrow band gap polymers. Extended spectroscopic, solid state, electrochemical, and theoretical study.\nWe report here the synthesis of three novel pi-conjugated heterocyclic mixed trimers that contain two electron-donating 3,4-ethylenedioxy-2-thienyl (EDOT) units covalently attached to a central proquinoid electron-accepting thienopyrazine moiety (two of these narrow-HOMO-LUMO gap D-A-D compounds also bear hexyl side chains attached either to the outermost alpha positions of the EDOT end rings or to the beta positions of the pyrazine fused ring). The modification of the terthiophene structure upon EDO, pyrazine, and hexyl substitutions has been treated in detail with spectroscopic and theoretical arguments. Solid-state properties reveal the occurrence of short intramolecular contacts between heteroatoms of adjacent rings. The analysis of the structure of the pi-conjugated backbone of each molecule is consistent with a partial quinoid-like pattern which partially reverts to be subtly more aromatic depending on the topology of the positive inductive effect of the hexyl chains. This quinoidization is a consequence of the appearance of a D(EDOT)-->A(PyT)<--D(EDOT) intramolecular charge transfer which further polarizes the structure. The same chemical concepts have been applied to address their electrochemical behavior. The three mixed trimers exhibit amphoteric properties due to the combination of electron acceptor and donor groups. Given their relative low HOMO-LUMO energy gap, these trimers promise to be good candidates for obtaining polymers with significant low energy gap combining electroactivity.",
   "Bio-smart hydrogels: co-joined molecular recognition and signal transduction in biosensor fabrication and drug delivery.\nTwo classes of polymers that are currently receiving widespread attention in biosensor development are hydrogels and conducting electroactive polymers. The present study reports on the integration of these two materials to produce electroactive hydrogel composites that physically entrap enzymes within their matrices for biosensor construction and chemically stimulated controlled release. Enhanced biosensing capabilities of these membranes have been demonstrated in the fabrication of glucose, cholesterol and galactose amperometric biosensors. All biosensors displayed extended linear response ranges (10(-5)-10(-2) M), rapid response times (<60 s), retained storage stabilities of up to 1 year, and excellent screening of the physiological interferents ascorbic acid, uric acid, and acetaminophen. When the cross-linked hydrogel components of these composite membranes were prepared with the amine containing dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate monomer the result was polymeric devices that swelled in response to pH changes (neutral to acidic). Entrapment of glucose oxidase within these materials made them glucose-responsive through the formation of gluconic acid. When insulin was co-loaded with glucose oxidase into these \"bio-smart\" devices, there was a twofold increase in insulin release rate when the devices were immersed in glucose solutions. This demonstrates the potential of such systems to function as a chemically-synthesized artificial pancreas.",
   "Imidazolium-Containing ABA Triblock Copolymers as Electroactive Devices.\nTwo-step reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization and two subsequent postpolymerization modification steps afforded well-defined ABA triblock copolymers featuring mechanically reinforcing polystyrene outer blocks and 1-methylimidazole-neutralized poly(acrylic acid)-based central blocks. Size exclusion chromatography and (1)H NMR spectroscopy confirmed predictable molecular weights and narrow distributions. The ionic liquid (IL) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([EMIm][OTf]) was incorporated at 30 wt % into polymeric films. Thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and dynamic mechanical analysis determined the thermomechanical properties of the polymers and polymer-IL composites. Atomic force microscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) determined surface and bulk morphologies, and poly(Sty-b-AA(MeIm)-b-Sty) exhibited a change from packed cylindrical to lamellar morphology in SAXS upon IL incorporation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy determined the in-plane ionic conductivities of the polymer-IL membranes (\u03c3 \u223c 10(-4) S/cm). A device fabricated from poly(Sty-b-AA(MeIm)-b-Sty) with 30 wt % incorporated IL demonstrated mechanical actuation under a low applied voltage of 4 V.",
   "Carbon fibre-based microbiosensors for in vivo measurements of acetylcholine and choline.\nThis report describes technical improvements to the manufacture of a carbon fibre electrode for the stable and sensitive detection of H2O2 (detection limit at 0.5 microM). This electrode was also modified through the co-immobilisation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and/or choline oxidase (ChOx) in a bovine serum albumin (BSA) membrane for the development of a sensor for in vivo measurements of acetylcholine and choline. Amperometric measurements were performed using a conventional three-electrode system forming part of a flow-injection set-up at an applied potential of 800-1100 mV relative to an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The optimised biosensor obtained was reproducible and stable, and exhibited a detection limit of 1 microM for both acetylcholine and choline. However, due to the high operating potential used, the biosensor was prone to substantial interference from other electroactive compounds, such as ascorbic acid. Therefore, in a further step, a mediated electron transfer approach was used that incorporated horseradish peroxidase into an osmium-based redox hydrogel layered onto the active surface of the electrode. Afterwards, a Nafion layer and a coating containing AChE and/or ChOx co-immobilised in a BSA membrane were successively deposited. This procedure further increased the selectivity of the biosensor, when operated in the same flow-injection system but at an applied potential of -50 mV relative to an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The sensor exhibited good selectivity and a high sensitivity over a concentration range (0.3-100 microM) suitable for the measurement of choline and acetylcholine in vivo.",
   "Potentiometric thick-film sensor for the determination of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.\nA potentiometric thick-film biosensor for the determination of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is presented. The selective membranes consist of two layers. The first is a choline- and H(+)-selective membrane made from a poly(vinyl chloride)-poly(vinyl acetate) copolymer which is plasticized with 2-nitrophenyl octyl ether. It contains 1% m/m of the ion-pair choline phosphotungstate as an electroactive compound. Both products of the enzymic cleavage, choline and H+, are detected. The second layer is placed above the first and is made from a poly(vinyl acetate)-polyethylene dispersion polymer. It is loaded with 2% m/m of acetylcholinesterase isolated from electric eel. The linear region of the response curve extends from 2 x 10(-5) to 0.01 mol dm-3 in buffer solution and undiluted horse serum. The detection limit is 5 x 10(-6) mol dm-3 and the response time is about 4 min.",
   "Development of Coarse-Grained Liquid-Crystal Polymer Model with Efficient Electrostatic Interaction: Toward Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Electroactive Materials.\nLiquid-crystal polymers (LCPs) are well known materials for functional sensor and actuators, because of their high-responsiveness to an electric field. Owing to their complex physical nature, however, the prediction of the functions of LCPs is a challenge. To attack this problem from a molecular point of view, a simulation study is a promising approach. In this work, for future applications of molecular dynamics simulations to problems involving an electric field, we develop an LCP model which consists of coarse-grained mesogenic molecules and smeared charges. For the smearing function of the electrostatic force, the Gauss error function is introduced. This smearing is optimized to attain a reasonable accuracy for phase transition phenomena of liquid crystal while numerical instabilities arising from the singularity of the Coulomb potential are circumvented. For swelling systems, our LCP model exhibits the characteristics of both liquid crystals and unentangled polymer chains; orientational order of the mesogenic units and Rouse-like relaxation dynamics. Our coarse-grained LCP model successfully incorporates electric charges and dipoles and is therefore applicable to problems concerning an electric field.",
   "Nanodimensional organostannoxane molecular assemblies.\nOrganooxotin cages, clusters, and coordination polymers containing [Sn 2(mu-O)], [Sn 2(mu-OH)], [Sn 2(mu-O) 2], [Sn 2(mu-OH) 2], and [Sn 3(mu 3-O)(mu-OR) 3] building blocks have been assembled by the reactions of organotin precursors with phosphonic, phosphinic, carboxylic, or sulfonic acids. Various synthetic methodologies including Sn-C bond cleavage reactions and solventless procedures have been utilized to generate several nanodimensional organostannoxane assemblies. The synthesis, structure, and structural interrelationship of these diverse organostannoxane compounds are discussed. The synthetic knowledge gained to prepare specific organostannoxane structural forms in high yields has been utilized for the construction of dendrimer-like molecules. These contain a central stannoxane core and a functional periphery. The functional periphery can be readily modulated to assemble photoactive, electroactive, or multisite coordinating molecules. The synthesis, structure, and potential uses of these compounds are discussed.",
   "Poly(1,1-bis(dialkylamino)propan-1,3-diyl)s; conformationally-controlled oligomers bearing electroactive groups.\nThe design of polymers with repeating [C(NR2)2CH2CH2] units which may simultaneously provide conformational control and contain repeating electroactive centres is discussed; (NR2)2 groups would be ideally provided by ortho-phenylenediamine derivatives, with 1,8-diaminonaphthalenes as alternatives. Oligomers containing 1,8-bis(methylamino)naphthalenes, up to the hexamer, were obtained by condensation of oligomers of CH3[COCH2CH2](n)COCH3 with 1,8-bis(methylamino)naphthalene, but attempts to prepare related oligomers from 1,2-bis(alkylamino)benzenes were unsuccessful, as only terminal ketone groups could be converted to aminals. Evidence for a strong preference for all-anti conformations of the main chain in the naphthalenediamine oligomers is provided by ring current effects on 1H NMR shifts, and by X-ray structures, which also provide evidence of intercalation in the solid state. Electrochemical studies of these oligomers show irreversible oxidation of oligomers in solution, but oxidation of longer oligomers leads to the deposition of a reddish-pink insoluble material which shows two reversible oxidation waves. Possible interpretation of these results is discussed.",
   "Synthesis and characterization of new electroactive polypyrrole-chondroitin sulphate A substrates.\nNovel composite polypyrrole/chondroitin-4-sulphate films with cation-exchange properties were synthesized by the electrochemical polymerization of pyrrole in the presence of chondroitin-4-sulphate (CSA) sodium salt, acting as dopant anion at neutral pH. The negatively charged biomolecule was found to be permanently entrapped in the polypyrrole (PPy) membrane which resulted, as expected, facilitated in the mass transport by mobile cationic counterions. The porous nature of the substrates was identified as the most influential factor controlling the morphology. The morphology, in turn, affects the interaction between the material surface and the tissues on a cellular level. In this work in vitro analyses of human fibroblast response to polypyrrole/chondroitin-4-sulphate films were performed to focus on the different steps of cell reactions towards defined surface properties.",
   "High-power lithium-ion capacitor using LiMnBO3 -nanobead anode and polyaniline-nanofiber cathode with excellent cycle life.\nLiMnBO3 nanobeads (LMB-NB) with uniform size and distribution were synthesized using a urea-assisted microwave/solvothermal method. The potential application of LMB-NBs as an anode for a lithium-ion hybrid capacitor (Li-AHC) was tested with a polyaniline-nanofiber (PANI-NF) cathode in a nonaqueous LiPF6 (1\u2009M)-ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and charge-discharge (C/DC) studies revealed that the PANI-NF/LMB-NB cell showed an exceptional capacitance behavior between 0-3 V along with a prolonged cycle life. A discharge capacitance of about 125 F g(-1) , and energy and power densities of about 42 Wh kg(-1) and 1500 W kg(-1) , respectively, could be obtained at a current density of 1 A g(-1) ; those Li-AHC values are higher relative to cells containing various lithium intercalation materials in nonaqueous electrolytes. In addition, the PANI-NF/LMB-NB cell also had an outstanding rate performance with a capacitance of 54 F g(-1) and a power density of 3250 W kg(-1) at a current density of 2.25 A g(-1) and maintained 94% of its initial value after 30000 cycles. This improved capacitive performance with an excellent electrochemical stability could be the result of the morphological features and inherent conductive nature of the electroactive species.",
   "Functional histidine/nickel hexacyanoferrate nanotube assembly for biosensor applications.\nBy exploring the properties of histidine, functional histidine/nickel hexacyanoferrate nanotube assembly was prepared using nanopore alumina template via a sequential deposition strategy and demonstrated for improved biosensing. The vertically oriented nanotube assembly has a nanotube density approximately 8x10(8)cm(-2) and can be stably attached to the glassy carbon electrode surface. The nanotube assembly formed provides an ordered well-defined three-dimensional (3D) structure with good electron transfer efficiency and a large specific surface area with abundant electroactive sites. Gold nanoparticles were then absorbed onto nanotube surfaces through amino group provided by histidine, and were used for further absorption of glucose oxidase into the 3D matrix. The histidine and gold nanoparticles on the nanotube surface provide a favorable microenvironment to keep the bioactivity of the enzymes with a low apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (K(Mapp)) of 2.15 mM, and the ordered orientation of the nanotube assembly facilitated enzyme-substrate contact. The biosensor was sensitive and selective toward glucose with a linear range covered from 2 microM to 20 mM of glucose. The biosensor was used to determine glucose concentration in real blood samples with satisfactory results.",
   "Electroactive nanoparticle directed assembly of functionalized graphene nanosheets into hierarchical structures with hybrid compositions for flexible supercapacitors.\nHierarchical structures of hybrid materials with the controlled compositions have been shown to offer a breakthrough for energy storage and conversion. Here, we report the integrative assembly of chemically modified graphene (CMG) building blocks into hierarchical complex structures with the hybrid composition for high performance flexible pseudocapacitors. The formation mechanism of hierarchical CMG/Nafion/RuO2 (CMGNR) microspheres, which is triggered by the cooperative interplay during the in situ synthesis of RuO2 nanoparticles (NPs), was extensively investigated. In particular, the hierarchical CMGNR microspheres consisting of the aggregates of CMG/Nafion (CMGN) nanosheets and RuO2 NPs provided large surface area and facile ion accessibility to storage sites, while the interconnected nanosheets offered continuous electron pathways and mechanical integrity. The synergistic effect of CMGNR hybrids on the supercapacitor (SC) performance was derived from the hybrid composition of pseudocapacitive RuO2 NPs with the conductive CMGNs as well as from structural features. Consequently, the CMGNR-SCs showed a specific capacitance as high as 160 F g(-1), three-fold higher than that of conventional graphene SCs, and a capacitance retention of >95% of the maximum value even after severe bending and 1000 charge-discharge tests due to the structural and compositional features.",
   "Prediction of the Actuation Property of Cu Ionic Polymer-Metal Composites Based on Backpropagation Neural Networks.\nIonic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) actuators are one of the most prominent electroactive polymers with expected widespread use in the future. The IPMC bends in response to a small applied electric field as a result of the mobility of cations in the polymer network. This paper proposes a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm backpropagation neural network (LMA-BPNN) prediction model applicable for Cu/Nafion-based ionic polymer-metal composites to predict the actuation property. The proposed approach takes the dimension ratio (DR) and stimulation voltage as the input layer, displacement and blocking force as the output layer, and trains the LMA-BPNN with the experimental data so as to obtain a mapping relationship between the input and the output and obtain the predicted values of displacement and blocking force. An IPMC actuating system is set up to generate a collection of the IPMC actuating data. Based on the input/output training data, the most suitable structure was found out for the BPNN model to represent the IPMC actuation behavior. After training and verification, a 2-9-3-1 BPNN structure for displacement and a 2-9-4-1 BPNN structure for blocking force indicate that the structure can provide a good reference value for the IPMC. The results showed that the BPNN model based on the LMA could predict the displacement and blocking force of the IPMC. Therefore, this model can become an effective solution for IPMC control applications.",
   "A label-free electrochemical immunosensor based on the novel signal amplification system of AuPdCu ternary nanoparticles functionalized polymer nanospheres.\nA sensitive label-free electrochemical immunosensor was designed using a novel signal amplification system for quantitative detecting hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) supported surfactant-free AuPdCu ternary nanoparticles (AuPdCu/N-GQDs), which featured with good conductivity and excellent catalytic properties for the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), was synthesized by a simple and benign hydrothermal procedure. At the same time, the electroactive polymer nanospheres (PS) was synthesized by infinite coordination polymers of ferrocenedicarboxylic acid, which could play as carrier and electronic mediator to load AuPdCu/N-GQDs. The PS not only improved the ability to load antibodies because of the good biocompatibility, but also accelerated electron transport of the electrode interface attribute to plentiful ferrocene unit. Thus, the prepared AuPdCu/N-GQDs@PS has abilities of good biocompatibility, catalytic activity and electrical conductivity to be applied as transducing materials to amplify electrochemical signal in detection of HBsAg. Under optimal conditions, the fabricated immunosensor exhibited high sensitivity and stability in the detection of HBsAg. A linear relationship between current signals and the concentrations of HBsAg was obtained in the range from 10fg/mL to 50ng/mL and the detection limit of HBsAg was 3.3fg/mL (signal-to-noise ratio of 3). Moreover, the designed immunosensor with excellent selectivity, reproducibility and stability shows excellent performance in detection of human serum samples. Furthermore, this label-free electrochemical immunosensor has promising application in clinical diagnosis of HBsAg.",
   "Assessment of in vitro bioactivity of hyaluronic acid and sulfated hyaluronic acid functionalized electroactive polymer.\nElectrically conductive polypyrrole (PPY) was surface functionalized with hyaluronic acid (HA) and sulfated hyaluronic acid (SHA) to improve its surface biocompatibility. The immobilization of HA on the PPY film was facilitated by the use of a cross-linker having the appropriate functional groups. The biological activity of the HA functionalized PPY film was assessed by means of an in vitro PC12 cell culture. The cell attachment on different substrates was studied and determined by bicinchoninic acid protein analysis. Cell attachment on the HA functionalized PPY film surface was significantly enhanced in the presence of nerve growth factor. The SHA functionalized PPY film was obtained by the sulfonation of the immobilized HA using pyridinesulfonate. The retention of the biological activity of the immobilized HA after sulfonation was evaluated by the in vitro assessment of the plasma recalcification time (PRT) and platelet adhesion on the substrate. The PRT observed from the SHA functionalized PPY film was significantly prolonged compared with the HA functionalized PPY. Some reduction of platelet adhesion was observed for the SHA functionalized PPY film, compared with that of the HA functionalized PPY film.",
   "Poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) graphene oxide composite coatings for controlling magnesium implant corrosion.\nMagnesium (Mg) is a promising biodegradable implant material because of its appropriate mechanical properties and safe degradation products. However, in vivo corrosion speed and hydrogen gas production need to be controlled for uses in biomedical applications. Here we report the development of a conducting polymer 3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene (PEDOT) and graphene oxide (GO) composite coating as a corrosion control layer. PEDOT/GO was electropolymerized on Mg samples in ethanol media. The coated Mg samples were subjected to various corrosion tests. The PEDOT/GO coating significantly reduced the rate of corrosion as evidenced by lower Mg ion concentration and pH of the corrosion media. In addition, the coating decreased the evolved hydrogen. Electrochemical analysis of the corroding samples showed more positive corrosion potential, a decreased corrosion current, and an increase in the polarization resistance. PEDOT/GO corrosion protection is attributed to three factors; an initial passive layer preventing solution ingress, buildup of negative charges in the film, and formation of corrosion protective Mg phosphate layer through redox coupling with Mg corrosion. To explore the biocompatibility of the coated implants in vitro, corrosion media from PEDOT/GO coated or uncoated Mg samples were exposed to cultured neurons where PEDOT/GO coated samples showed decreased toxicity. These results suggest that PEDOT/GO coating will be an effective treatment for controlling corrosion of Mg based medical implants.",
   "Nitric oxide monitoring in brain extracellular fluid: characterisation of Nafion-modified Pt electrodes in vitro and in vivo.\nA Nafion(5 pre-coats/2 dip-coats)-modified Pt sensor developed for real-time neurochemical monitoring has now been characterised in vitro for the sensitive and selective detection of nitric oxide (NO). A potentiodynamic profile at bare Pt established +0.9 V (vs. SCE) to be the most appropriate applied potential for NO oxidation. The latter was confirmed using oxyhaemoglobin and N(2), both of which reduced the NO signal to baseline levels. Results indicated enhanced NO sensitivity at the Nafion(5/2) sensor (1.67 +/- 0.08 nA microM(-1)) compared to bare Pt (1.08 +/- 0.20 nA microM(-1)) and negligible interference from a wide range of endogenous electroactive interferents such as ascorbic acid, dopamine and its metabolites, NO(2)(-) and H(2)O(2). The response time of 33.7 +/- 2.7 s was found to improve (19.0 +/- 3.4 s) when the number of Nafion layers was reduced to 2/1 and an insulating outer layer of poly(o-phenylenediamine) added. When tested under physiological conditions of 37 degrees C the response time of the Nafion(5/2) sensor improved to 14.00 +/- 2.52 s. In addition, the NO response was not affected by physiological concentrations of O(2) despite the high reactivity of the two species for each other. The limit of detection (LOD) was estimated to be 5 nM while stability tests in lipid (phosphatidylethanolamine; PEA) and protein (bovine serum albumin; BSA) solutions (10%) found an initial ca. 38% drop in sensitivity in the first 24 h which remained constant thereafter. Preliminary in vivo experiments involving systemic administration of NO and L-arginine produced increases in the signals recorded at the Nafion(5/2) sensor implanted in the striatum of freely-moving rats, thus supporting reliable in vivo recording of NO.",
   "Electroactive Composite of FeCl3 -Doped P3HT/PLGA with Adjustable Electrical Conductivity for Potential Application in Neural Tissue Engineering.\nConducting polymers (CPs) is one of intelligent biomaterials with the specific properties of reversible redox states, which have a significant effects on the cell behaviors and nerve tissue regeneration. However, the effects of CPs with different electrical conductivity on the behaviors of nerve cells are rarely reported. Therefore, a kind of Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with certain molecular weight is synthesized by Kumada catalyst transfer polymerization (KCTP) method and employed to prepare bioabsorbable and electroactive intelligent composites of Poly(3-hexylthiophene)/Poly(glycolide-lactide) (P3HT/PLGA). FeCl3 doping electroactive membranes with different electrical conductivities are prepared to investigate the cell behaviors. On the substrate with higher electrical conductivity, the proliferation of rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cells (PC12 cells) is significantly promoted and neurite length is increased obviously. In particular, the most significant improvements are the neuron gene expression of Synapsin 1 and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) by the composites with high conductivity. These results suggest that P3HT/PLGA with suitable electrical conductivity have a positive role in promoting neural growth and differentiation, which is promising for advancing potential application of nerve repair and regeneration.",
   "Polyaniline, an electroactive polymer, supports adhesion and proliferation of cardiac myoblasts.\nConductive polymers, such as polypyrrole, have recently been studied as potential surfaces/matrices for cell- and tissue-culture applications. We have investigated the adhesion and proliferation properties of H9c2 cardiac myoblasts on a conductive polyaniline substrate. Both the non-conductive emeraldine base (PANi) and its conductive salt (E-PANi) forms of polyaniline were found to be biocompatible, viz., allowing for cell attachment and proliferation and, in the case of E-PANi, maintaining electrical conductivity. By comparison to tissue-culture-treated polystyrene (TCP), the initial adhesion of H9c2 cells to both PANi and E-PANi was slightly reduced by 7% (P < 0.05, n = 18). By contrast, the overall rate of cell proliferation on the conductive surfaces, although initially decreased, was similar to control TCP surfaces. After 6 days in culture on the different surfaces, the cells formed confluent monolayers which were morphologically indistinguishable. Furthermore, we observed that E-PANi, when maintained in an aqueous physiologic environment, retained a significant level of electrical conductivity for at least 100 h, even though this conductivity gradually decreased by about 3 orders of magnitude over time. These results demonstrate the potential for using polyaniline as an electroactive polymer in the culture of excitable cells and open the possibility of using this material as an electroactive scaffold for cardiac and/or neuronal tissue engineering applications that require biocompatibility of conductive polymers.",
   "Electrospun silk fibroin scaffolds coated with reduced graphene promote neurite outgrowth of PC-12 cells under electrical stimulation.\nNovel approaches to neural research require biocompatible materials capable to act as electrode structures or scaffolds for tissue engineering in order to stimulate or restore the functionality of damaged tissues. This work offers promising results that indicate the potential use of electrospun silk fibroin (SF) scaffolds coated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in this sense. The coated material becomes conductor and electroactive. A complete characterisation of SF/rGO scaffolds is provided in terms of electrochemistry, mechanical behaviour and chemical conformation of fibroin. The excellent biocompatibility of this novel material is proved with cultures of PC-12 cells. The coating with rGO improved the adhesion of cells in comparison with cells growing onto the surface of pure SF scaffolds. Also, the use of SF/rGO scaffolds combined with electrical stimulation promoted the differentiation into neural phenotypes reaching comparable or even superior levels to those obtained by means of the traditional treatment with neural growth factor (NGF).",
   "Highly stable Ni-MOF comprising triphenylamine moieties as a high-performance redox indicator for sensitive aptasensor construction.\nElectroactive metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with large surface area and manipulatable structural properties show promise as a new type of signal probe for electrochemical biosensing application. In this work, an electroactive Ni-MOF, assembled by the redox-active ligands 4,4',4\u2033-Tricarboxytriphenylamine (H3TCA), a triphenylamine derivatives, as the electroactive source and magnetic ordered Ni4O4 clusters as electronic transport nodes, is first designed and applied for electrochemical aptasensing of thrombin (Tb). The designed Ni-MOF probe realizes a stable and sensitive electrochemical signal output based on simple sandwich-type aptasensing because the high-content TCA active sites and good magnetic ordered intermediate of Ni4O4 clusters are periodically arranged in well-defined porous structure of the MOF. The Ni-MOF probe assembled by redox-active ligand presents the high stability and can be directly applied in electrochemical aptasensor, avoiding any post-modification and the addition of redox mediators. As a result, the constructed electrochemical aptasensor shows a wide linear relationship for Tb from 0.05 pM to 50\u202fnM and a detection limit of 0.016 pM (S/N\u202f=\u202f3). Furthermore, the proposed aptasensor is successfully applied to analysis of target Tb in real serum sample with satisfactory results. The present work indicates that fabricating a redox-active organic molecule in functionalized MOFs offer a feasible strategy to design high-stable electroactive MOFs for construction of electrochemical biosensors with simplicity, high selectivity and sensitivity.",
   "Ultrathin conjugated polymer network films of carbazole functionalized poly(p-phenylenes) via electropolymerization.\nUltrathin films of a cross-linked and chemically distinct conjugated poly(p-phenylene) network via electropolymerization are described. The amphiphilic network precursor was synthesized by incorporating the alkoxy carbazole group (-O(CH2)5Cb) to a poly(p-phenylene) (C6PPPOH) backbone. In order to investigate the combined thin film electrochemical and photophysical properties of poly(p-phenylene)s and polycarbazole conjugated polymers, C6PPPC5Cb was deposited on substrates using the Langmuir Blodgett Kuhn (LBK) method. The monolayer isotherm of the polymer, C6PPPC5Cb, showed a liquid expanded region slightly different from the parent polymer C6PPPOH. Multilayers (up to 30 layers) were transferred to different substrates such as quartz, gold coated LaSFN9 and ITO substrates for analysis. For conversion to a conjugated polymer network (CPN) film, the electroactive carbazole group was electropolymerized using cyclic voltammetry (CV) resulting in polycarbazole linking units. The differences in the film properties and corresponding changes in the electrochemical behavior indicate the importance of film thickness and electron/ion transport process in cross linked network films. From the electrochemical studies, the scan rate was found to have a considerable effect on electropolymerization with higher oxidation and reduction peak values found for the rigid network polymer compared to the uncrosslinked polymers.",
   "Electroactive degradable copolymers enhancing osteogenic differentiation from bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells.\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have attracted great interest in the field of regenerative medicine, particularly in bone regeneration. Osteogenic differentiation from MSCs is regulated by various environmental factors including hormones, growth factors, chemicals and physical cues from biomaterials. We present the use of electroactive degradable copolymers to guide the osteogenic differentiation from bone marrow derived MSCs (BMSCs). The biodegradable conductive copolymers based on polylactide and tunable contents of the aniline oligomer were synthesized by ring opening polymerization and free radical polymerization, and subsequent functionalization with the aniline tetramer. Electroactive nanofibrous scaffolds were created via a thermally induced phase separation technique. The cell culture of BMSCs and MC3T3-E1 cells on electroactive copolymers showed that these copolymers were cytocompatible and the proliferation for both cells was significantly enhanced. Osteogenic differentiation from BMSCs on the electroactive copolymers was promoted compared to polylactide in terms of gene expression and von Kossa staining. Furthermore, protein adsorption on the electroactive copolymer surface was greatly increased, and this may contribute to the enhanced proliferation and differentiation of BMSCs. This is the first report about degradable electroactive polymers directing osteogenic differentiation from BMSCs and the results indicated that electroactive degradable polymers have great potential for application in bone regeneration.",
   "Enhancing extracellular electron transfer efficiency and bioelectricity production by vapor polymerization Poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/MnO2 hybrid anode.\nElectron transfer efficiency in electroactive biofilm is the limiting factor for bioelectricity output of bioelectrochemical system. Here, carbon felt (CF) is coated with manganese dioxide (MnO2) which acts as electron mediator in electroactive biofilm. A wrapping layer of conducting Poly 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene is developed to protect the MnO2 and enhance electron transfer efficiency of MnO2 mediator. The hybrid bioanode (PEDOT/MnO2/CF bioanode) delivered the highest electron transfer efficiency (6.3\u202f\u00d7\u202f10-9\u202fmol\u202fcm-2\u202fs-1/2) and the highest capacitance of 4.78\u202fF, much higher than bare CF bioanode (1.50\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.04\u202f\u00d7\u202f10-9\u202fmol\u202fcm-2\u202fs-1/2 and 0.42\u202fF). As a result, microbial fuel cells could produce a maximum power density of 1534\u202f\u00b1\u202f13\u202fmW\u202fm-2, approximately 57.7% higher than that with the bare carbon felt anode (972\u202f\u00b1\u202f21\u202fmW\u202fm-2). Possible mechanisms are proposed to help understanding the different function of the PEDOT and MnO2 on the anodic layer. This study introduces an effective method for the fabrication of high performance anode.",
   "Reactive coupling of poly(ethylene glycol) on electroactive polyaniline films for reduction in protein adsorption and platelet adhesion.\nPoly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-coupled polyaniline (PANI) film surfaces were prepared by incorporating the chlorinie end-capped methoxy PEG (mPEGCl) of molecular weight of about 2000 onto the emeraldine (EM) base form of PANI via N-alkylation. The microstructure and composition of the mPEG-coupled PANI (mPEG-c-PANI) surfaces were characterized by atomic force microscopy, contact angle measurement and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The concentration of surface-coupled mPEG increased with the increase in concentration of the mPEGCl solution. The mPEG-c-PANI film surfaces exhibited enhanced ability to repel protein adsorption, with only an moderate reduction in their electrical conductivity. The mPEG-c-PANI surface with a high concentration of coupled mPEG also exhibited good resistance towards platelet adhesion.",
   "Photorefractive polymers sensitized by two-photon absorption.\nWe demonstrate the recording of holograms and their nondestructive readout in a photorefractive polymer, using two-photon absorption. Sensitivity is provided by the excitation of the electroactive chromophore with femtosecond pulses, followed by charge injection into the photoconducting poly(N -vinylcarbazole) matrix. The holograms can be fully erased with a pulsed laser source but are insensitive to cw laser beams with the same wavelength. Studies of the field and intensity dependence of the diffraction efficiency indicate that the holograms are formed through the photorefractive effect.",
   "Resolving sub-molecular binding and electrical switching mechanisms of single proteins at electroactive conducting polymers.\nPolymer-based electrodes for interfacing biological tissues are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Their many functions place them at the cross-roads of electromaterials, biomaterials, and drug-delivery systems. For conducting polymers, the mechanism of conductivity requires doping with anionic molecules such as extracellular matrix molecules, a process that distinguishes them as biomaterials and provides a means to control interactions at the cellular-electrode interface. However, due to their complex structure, directly observing the selective binding of target molecules or proteins has so far eluded researchers. This situation is compounded by the polymer's ability to adopt different electronic states that alter the polymer-dopant interactions. Here, the ability to resolve sub-molecular binding specificity between sulfate and carboxyl groups of dopants and heparin binding domains of human plasma fibronectin is demonstrated. The interaction exploits a form of biological 'charge complementarity' to enable specificity. When an electrical signal is applied to the polymer, the specific interaction is switched to a non-specific, high-affinity binding state that can be reversibly controlled using electrochemical processes. Both the specific and non-specific interactions are integral for controlling protein conformation and dynamics. These details, which represent the first direct measurement of biomolecular recognition between a single protein and any type of organic conductor, give new molecular insight into controlling cellular interactions on these polymer surfaces.",
   "Conjugated polymer network films of poly(p-phenylene vinylene) with hole-transporting carbazole pendants: dual photoluminescence and electrochromic behavior.\nA series of poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) copolymers functionalized with hole-transport and electrochemically active carbazole units as pendant moieties is reported. These polymers exhibit photoluminescence properties by virtue of the PPV analogous backbone. They were also designed as precursor polymer bearing the electroactive carbazole group to form conjugated polymer network (CPN) films by electrodeposition. The electrochemical polymerization of the pendant units eventually lead to a dual property electro-optically active thin film - photoluminescence (PL) behavior that can be attenuated with CPN formation, and a reversible doping and dedoping processes at controlled potentials that lead to an electrochromic behavior. This reveals the ability to incorporate complementary optical and electro-optical properties within the same film using the CPN approach. It should be possible to design and synthesize other PPV \u03c0-conjugated polymers with efficient pendant hole-transport groups exhibiting tunable PL and electrochromism with cross-linking.",
   "Structure-Property Relationships in Hybrid Cellulose Nanofibrils/Nafion-Based Ionic Polymer-Metal Composites.\nHerein, we report the production of ionic polymer-metal composites (IPMCs) hybridized with cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) as a partial substitute for Nafion\u00ae. The aim is not only to reduce the production cost and enhance respective mechanical/thermal properties but also to bestow a considerable degree of biodegradability to such products. Formulations with different CNF/Nafion\u00ae ratios were produced in a thin-film casting process. Crack-free films were air-dried and plated by platinum (Pt) through an oxidation-reduction reaction. The produced hybrids were analyzed in terms of thermal stability, mechanical and morphological aspects to examine their performance compared to the Nafion-based IPMC prior to plating process. Results indicated that films with higher CNF loadings had improved tensile strengths and elastic moduli but reduced ductility. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that the incorporation of CNF to the matrix reduced its thermal stability almost linearly, however, the onset of decomposition point remained above 120 \u00b0C, which was far above the temperature the composite membrane is expected to be exposed to. The addition of a cross-linking agent to the formulations helped with maintaining the integrity of the membranes during the plating process, thereby improving surface conductivity. The focus of the current study was on the physical and morphological properties of the films, and the presented data advocate the potential utilization of CNF as a nontoxic and sustainable bio-polymer for blending with perfluorosulfonic acid-based co-polymers, such as Nafion\u00ae, to be used in electroactive membranes.",
   "Biomedical Application of Electroactive\u00a0Polymers in Electrochemical Sensors: A Review.\nConducting polymers are of interest due to their unique behavior on exposure to electric fields, which has led to their use in flexible electronics, sensors, and biomaterials. The unique electroactive properties of conducting polymers allow them to be used to prepare biosensors that enable real time, point of care (POC) testing. Potential advantages of these devices include their low cost and low detection limit, ultimately resulting in increased access to treatment. This article presents a review of the characteristics of conducting polymer-based biosensors and the recent advances in their application in the recognition of disease biomarkers.",
   "Shape-Memory PVDF Exhibiting Switchable Piezoelectricity.\nIn this study, a material is designed which combines the properties of shape-memory and electroactive polymers. This is achieved by covalent cross-linking of polyvinylidene fluoride. The resulting polymer network exhibits excellent shape-memory properties with a storable strain of 200%, and fixity as well as recovery values of 100%. Programming upon rolling induces the transformation from the nonelectroactive \u03b1-phase to the piezoelectric \u03b2-phase. The highest \u03b2-phase content is found to be 83% for a programming strain of 200% affording a d33 value of -30 pm V(-1). This is in good accordance with literature known values for piezoelectric properties. Thermal triggering this material does not only result in a shape change but also renders the material nonelectroactive.",
   "Chiral conducting surfaces via electrochemical oxidation of L-leucine-oligothiophenes.\nPolythiophenes bearing a specific chiral center such as L-leucine have been prepared via the electrochemical oxidation of a series of L-leucine functionalized oligothiophenes (monothiophenes and terthiophenes). These oligothiophenes have been prepared through the condensation of L-leucine methyl ester and the corresponding thiophene monomers in the presence of hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) followed by hydrolysis of the esters. The electroactive polymers are electrochemically stable and exhibit excellent adhesive properties on electrode surfaces (platinum, gold, and glassy carbon) as well as interesting optical properties in both doped and undoped states. Hydrogen bonds between a free amino acid (L-leucine, D-leucine, L-alanine, D-alanine, and D/L-alanine) and the L-leucine based polythiophenes (chiral conducting surface) were probed using cyclic voltammetry. Preliminary results show that the capacitive current of a modified L-leucine-polythiophene electrode decreases as a result of the formation of a hydrogen bond barrier on the surface of the chiral conducting surface accompanied with a shift of the oxidation potential. Cyclic voltammetry responses resulting from the interaction of the chiral conducting surface with L and Dfree amino acid isomers are similar. The formation of hydrogen bonds between the chiral conducting surfaces and the free amino acids was characterized by (1)H NMR. A chemical shift was observed for the N-H group in monomer 6 as a result of the hydrogen bond formation between the L-leucine methyl ester (D-leucine methyl ester, D/L-leucine methyl ester) and monomer 6.",
   "Electrodes modified with electroinactive layers: distinguishing through-film transport from pinhole (pore) diffusion.\nElectrodes modified with layers, for example, of polymers or self-assembled monolayers, are of great importance from both the fundamental and applied points of view. Two different models of electrodes covered with electroinactive layers can be proposed. First, the electrode is covered with a uniform layer into which the electroactive species dissolves and then diffuses through, or second, the layer contains pinholes that are exclusively responsible for diffusional transport to the electrode. Both models are simulated and then compared to identify conditions under which they can be distinguished. The models are studied for a broad range of parameters reflecting experimentally viable values. Different types of cyclic voltammograms can be observed in the studied models corresponding to classical Randles-Sevcik, thin layer, and steady-state behaviors. We show that the models can be distinguished experimentally through recording cyclic voltammograms over a sufficiently broad range of voltage scan rates.",
   "Strategies to Control Performance of 3D-Printed, Cable-Driven Soft Polymer Actuators: From Simple Architectures to Gripper Prototype.\nThe following is a study of the performance of soft cable-driven polymer actuators produced by multimaterial 3D printing. We demonstrate that the mechanical response of the polymer actuator with an embedded cable can be flexibly tuned through the targeted selection of actuator architecture. Various strategies, such as the addition of discrete or periodic stiff inserts, the sectioning of the actuator, or the shifting of the cable channel are employed to demonstrate ways to achieve more controllable deformed shape during weight lifting or reduce the required actuation force. To illustrate these concepts, we design and manufacture a prototype of the soft polymer gripper, which is capable of manipulating small, delicate objects. The explored strategies can be utilized in other types of soft actuators, employing, for instance, actuation by means of electroactive polymers.",
   "Artificial antibodies for troponin T by its imprinting on the surface of multiwalled carbon nanotubes: its use as sensory surfaces.\nA novel artificial antibody for troponin T (TnT) was synthesized by molecular imprint (MI) on the surface of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). This was done by attaching TnT to the MWCNT surface, and filling the vacant spaces by polymerizing under mild conditions acrylamide (monomer) in N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (cross-linker) and ammonium persulphate (initiator). After removing the template, the obtained biomaterial was able to rebind TnT and discriminate it among other interfering species. Stereochemical recognition of TnT was confirmed by the non-rebinding ability displayed by non-imprinted (NI) materials, obtained by imprinting without a template. SEM and FTIR analysis confirmed the surface modification of the MWCNT. The ability of this biomaterial to rebind TnT was confirmed by including it as electroactive compound in a PVC/plasticizer mixture coating a wire of silver, gold or titanium. Anionic slopes of 50 mV decade(-1) were obtained for the gold wire coated with MI-based membranes dipped in HEPES buffer of pH 7. The limit of detection was 0.16 \u03bcg mL(-1). Neither the NI-MWCNT nor the MWCNT showed the ability to recognize the template. Good selectivity was observed against creatinine, sucrose, fructose, myoglobin, sodium glutamate, thiamine and urea. The sensor was tested successfully on serum samples. It is expected that this work opens new horizons on the design of new artificial antibodies for complex protein structures.",
   "Melanin incorporated electroactive and antioxidant silk fibroin nanofibrous scaffolds for nerve tissue engineering.\nNerve restoration and repair in the central nervous system is complicated and requires several factors to be considered while designing the scaffolds like being bioactive as well as having neuroinductive, neuroconductive and antioxidant properties. Aligned electrospun nanofibers provide necessary guidance and topographical cues required for directing the axonal and neurite outgrowth during regeneration. Conduction of nerve impulses is a mandatory feature of a typical nerve. The neuro-conductive property can be imparted by blending the biodegradable, bioactive polymers with conductive polymers. This will provide additional features, i.e., electrical cues to the already existing topographical and bioactive cues in order to make it a more multifaceted neuroregenerative approach. Hence in the present study, we used a combination of silk fibroin and melanin for the fabrication of random and aligned electrospun nanofibrous composite scaffolds. We performed the physico-chemical characterization and also assessed their antioxidant properties. We also evaluated their neurogenic potential using human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) for their cellular viability, proliferation, adhesion and differentiation levels. Designed nanofibrous scaffolds had adequate physical properties suitable as neural substrates to promote neuronal growth and regeneration. They stimulated the neuroblastoma cell attachment and viability indicating their biocompatible nature. Silk/melanin composite scaffolds have specifically exhibited high antioxidant nature proven by the radical scavenging activity. Additionally, the melanin incorporated aligned silk fibroin scaffolds promoted the cell differentiation into neurons and orientation along their axis. Our results confirmed the potential of melanin incorporated aligned silk fibroin scaffolds as the promising candidates for effective nerve regeneration and recovery.",
   "Effect of the supporting electrolyte anion on the thickness of PSS/PAH multilayer films and on their permeability to an electroactive probe.\nQuartz crystal microbalance and cyclic voltammetry are used to investigate the influence of the supporting salt of polyelectrolyte solutions on the buildup and the structure of PSS/PAH polyelectrolyte multilayers (PSS: poly(4-styrene sulfonate); PAH: poly(allylamine hydrochloride)). This film constitutes a model polyelectrolyte multilayer system. The supporting electrolytes were sodium salts where the nature of the anion was changed by following the Hofmeister series from cosmotropic to chaotropic anions (F-, Cl-, NO3-, ClO4-). For all the investigated anions, the film thickness increases linearly with the number of deposition steps.Wefind that chaotropic anions lead to larger thickness increments per bilayer during the film buildup than cosmotropic ones, confirming results found on PSS/PDADMA multilayers (PDADMA:poly(diallyldimethylammonium)). Films constituted by more than nine PSS/PAH bilayers are still permeable to hexacyanoferrate(II) ions, Fe(CN)(6)4-, whatever the nature of the supporting salt anion. On the other hand, these films are impermeable to ruthenium(II) hexamine ions, Ru(NH3)(6)2+, after the third PAH layer in the presence of NaF, NaCl, or NaNO3. These results are explained by the presence of an excess of positive charges in the film, which leads to a positive Donnan potential. We find that this potential is more positive when more chaotropic anions are used during the film buildup. We also find that a film constructed in the presence of chaotropic anions swells and becomes more permeable to Fe(CN)(6)4- ions when the film is brought into contact with a solution containing more cosmotropic anions. All our experimental findings can be explained by a strong interaction between chaotropic anions with the NH3+groups of PAH that is equivalent, as far as the multilayer buildup and electrochemical response is concerned, to a deprotonation of PAH as it is observed when the film is constructed at a higher pH. We thus arrive to a coherent explanation of the effect of the nature of the anions of the supporting electrolyte on the polyelectrolyte multilayer. We also find that great care must be taken when investigating polyelectrolyte multilayer films by electrochemical probing because electrochemical reactions involving the probes can appreciably modify the multilayer structure.",
   "Enzyme-modified carbon-fiber microelectrode for the quantification of dynamic fluctuations of nonelectroactive analytes using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry.\nNeurotransmission occurs on a millisecond time scale, but conventional methods for monitoring nonelectroactive neurochemicals are limited by slow sampling rates. Despite a significant global market, a sensor capable of measuring the dynamics of rapidly fluctuating, nonelectroactive molecules at a single recording site with high sensitivity, electrochemical selectivity, and a subsecond response time is still lacking. To address this need, we have enabled the real-time detection of dynamic glucose fluctuations in live brain tissue using background-subtracted, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. The novel microbiosensor consists of a simple carbon fiber surface modified with an electrodeposited chitosan hydrogel encapsulating glucose oxidase. The selectivity afforded by voltammetry enables quantitative and qualitative measurements of enzymatically generated H2O2 without the need for additional strategies to eliminate interfering agents. The microbiosensors possess a sensitivity and limit of detection for glucose of 19.4 \u00b1 0.2 nA mM(-1) and 13.1 \u00b1 0.7 \u03bcM, respectively. They are stable, even under deviations from physiological normoxic conditions, and show minimal interference from endogenous electroactive substances. Using this approach, we have quantitatively and selectively monitored pharmacologically evoked glucose fluctuations with unprecedented chemical and spatial resolution. Furthermore, this novel biosensing strategy is widely applicable to the immobilization of any H2O2 producing enzyme, enabling rapid monitoring of many nonelectroactive enzyme substrates.",
   "Permselective monolayer membrane based on two-dimensional cross-linked polysiloxane LB films for hydrogen peroxide detecting glucose sensors.\nNovel two-dimensional (2D) cross-linked polysiloxane LB films were prepared and applied for glucose sensing as H2O2-permselective films in order to block other electroactive interferences, such as L-ascorbic acid, L-cysteine, uric acid and acetaminophen; the 2D cross-linked polysiloxane monolayers were remarkably effective in eliminating interfering responses and had a rapid response for glucose, even though the films were only a monolayer thick.",
   "Multifunctional Electrochemical Platforms Based on the Michael Addition/Schiff Base Reaction of Polydopamine Modified Reduced Graphene Oxide: Construction and Application.\nIn this paper, a new strategy for the construction of multifunctional electrochemical detection platforms based on the Michael addition/Schiff base reaction of polydopamine modified reduced graphene oxide was first proposed. Inspired by the mussel adhesion proteins, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DA) was selected as a reducing agent to simultaneously reduce graphene oxide and self-polymerize to obtain the polydopamine-reduced graphene oxide (PDA-rGO). The PDA-rGO was then functionalized with thiols and amines by the reaction of thiol/amino groups with quinine groups of PDA-rGO via the Michael addition/Schiff base reaction. Several typical compounds containing thiol and/or amino groups such as 1-[(4-amino)phenylethynyl] ferrocene (Fc-NH2), cysteine (cys), and glucose oxidase (GOx) were selected as the model molecules to anchor on the surface of PDA-rGO using the strategy for construction of multifunctional electrochemical platforms. The experiments revealed that the composite grafted with ferrocene derivative shows excellent catalysis activity toward many electroactive molecules and could be used for individual or simultaneous detection of dopamine hydrochloride (DA) and uric acid (UA), or hydroquinone (HQ) and catechol (CC), while, after grafting of cysteine on PDA-rGO, simultaneous discrimination detection of Pb(2+) and Cd(2+) was realized on the composite modified electrode. In addition, direct electron transfer of GOx can be observed when GOx-PDA-rGO was immobilized on glassy carbon electrode (GCE). When glucose was added into the system, the modified electrode showed excellent electric current response toward glucose. These results inferred that the proposed multifunctional electrochemical platforms could be simply, conveniently, and effectively regulated through changing the anchored recognition or reaction groups. This study would provide a versatile method to design more detection or biosensing platforms through a chemical reaction strategy in the future.",
   "In-channel indirect amperometric detection of nonelectroactive anions for electrophoresis on a poly(dimethylsiloxane) microchip.\nIn the present paper, we describe a microfluidics-based sensing system for nonelectroactive anions under negative separation electric field by mounting a single carbon fiber disk working electrode (WE) in the end part of a poly(dimethylsiloxane) microchannel. In contrast to work in a positive separation electric field described in our previous paper (Anal. Chem. 2004, 76, 6902-6907), here the electrochemical reduction reaction at the WE is not coupled with the separation high-voltage (HV) system, whereas the electrochemical oxidation reaction at the WE is coupled with the separation HV system. The electroactive indicator is the carbon fiber WE itself but not dissolved oxygen. This provides a convenient and sensitive means for the determination of nonelectroactive anions by amperometry. The influences of separation voltage, detection potential, and the distance between the WE and the separation channel outlet on the response of the detector have been investigated. The present detection mode is successfully used to electrochemically detect F-, Cl-, SO4(2-), CH3COO-, H2PO4-. Based on the preliminary results, a detection limit of 2 microM and a dynamic range up to three orders of magnitude for Cl- could be achieved.",
   "Electroactive linear-hyperbranched block copolymers based on linear poly(ferrocenylsilane)s and hyperbranched poly(carbosilane)s.\nA convenient two-step protocol is presented for synthesis of linear-hyperbranched diblock copolymers consisting of a linear, organometallic poly(ferrocenylsilane) (PFS) block and hyperbranched poly(carbosilane) (hbPCS) segments. Linear PFS diblock copolymers were synthesized through photolytic ring-opening polymerization of dimethyl[1]silaferrocenophane as the first block and methylvinyl[1]silaferrocenophane as the second. These block copolymers served as polyfunctional cores in a subsequent hydrosilylation polyaddition of different silane-based AB(2) monomers. Three AB(2) monomers (methyldiallylsilane; methyldiundecenylsilane, and ferrocenyldiallylsilane) were investigated; they introduced structural diversity to the hyperbranched block and showed variable reactivity for the hydrosilylation reaction. In the case with the additional ferrocene moiety in the ferrocenyldiallylsilane monomer, an electroactive hyperbranched block was generated. No slow monomer addition was necessary for molecular-weight control of the hyperbranching polyaddition, as the core had much higher functionality and reactivity than the carbosilane monomers. Different block ratios were targeted and hybrid block copolymers with narrow polydispersity (<1.2) were obtained. All the resulting polymers were investigated and characterized by size exclusion chromatography, NMR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and TEM, and exhibited strongly anisotropic aggregation.",
   "pH-Sensitive \"on-off\" switching behavior of layer-by-layer films assembled by concanavalin A and dextran toward electroactive probes and its application in bioelectrocatalysis.\nConcanavalin A (Con A) and dextran (Dex) were assembled into {Con A/Dex}(n) layer-by-layer films on electrodes by the biospecific interaction between them. At {Con A/Dex}(n) film electrodes, the cyclic voltammetric (CV) response of different electroactive probes, such as Fe(CN)(6)(3-), Ru(NH(3))(6)(3+), ferrocenecarboxylic acid (Fc(COOH)), and ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (Fc(COOH)(2)), was very sensitive to the solution pH. For example, in pH 4.0 buffers, the films showed good permeability toward Fe(CN)(6)(3-), leading to a well-defined CV peak pair of Fe(CN)(6)(3-) with large peak currents at about 0.17 V vs SCE. In pH 9.0 buffers, however, the CV response of Fe(CN)(6)(3-) was significantly depressed or even could hardly be observed. This pH-sensitive \"on-off\" switching property of the films toward the probe should be attributed to the different electrostatic interaction between Fe(CN)(6)(3-) and the Con A constituent in the films at different pH and could be further used to control the electrocatalytic reduction of H(2)O(2) by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with Fe(CN)(6)(3-) as the diffusional electron transfer mediator. Fc(COOH)(2) showed the similar pH-dependent \"on-off\" behavior at {Con A/Dex}(n) film electrodes, and the corresponding pH-sensitive electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose by glucose oxidase (GOD) with Fc(COOH)(2) as the mediator was also realized. This work provides a new interface system that has the pH-sensitive \"on-off\" CV property, and the better understanding of the interactions involved in this model system may guide us to develop the novel kind of controllable biosensors based on enzymatic electrocatalysis.",
   "Incorporating conjugated carbonyl compounds into carbon nanomaterials as electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage.\nThe increasing demand for energy and growing concerns for environmental issues are promoting the development of organic electrode materials. Among these, conjugated carbonyl compounds (CCCs) represent one of the most attractive and promising candidates for sustainable and eco-benign energy storage devices in the coming future. However, most of the current compounds suffer from dissolution in organic electrolytes and low electronic conductivity, which result in severe capacity decay and poor rate performance. Recently, researchers have achieved considerable progress by introducing electroactive carbonyl compounds into carbon nanomaterials. This perspective provides an overview of the up-to-date development of these nanocomposites in metal ion batteries (lithium-ion batteries or sodium-ion batteries) and supercapacitors (SCs), including the synthesis, performance improvement and applications. We mainly focus on carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene and mesoporous carbon (MC) as carbon nanomaterials because of their high specific surface area, good conductivity, electrochemical stability and favourable interaction with conjugated carbonyl compounds. This strategy opens up new possibilities to realize cost-effective, sustainable and versatile energy storage devices.",
   "A review on robotic fish enabled by ionic polymer-metal composite artificial muscles.\nA novel actuating material, which is lightweight, soft, and capable of generating large flapping motion under electrical stimuli, is highly desirable to build energy-efficient and maneuverable bio-inspired underwater robots. Ionic polymer-metal composites are important category of electroactive polymers, since they can generate large bending motions under low actuation voltages. IPMCs are ideal artificial muscles for small-scale and bio-inspired robots. This paper takes a system perspective to review the recent work on IPMC-enabled underwater robots, from modeling, fabrication, and bio-inspired design perspectives. First, a physics-based and control-oriented model of IPMC actuator will be reviewed. Second, a bio-inspired robotic fish propelled by IPMC caudal fin will be presented and a steady-state speed model of the fish will be demonstrated. Third, a novel fabrication process for 3D actuating membrane will be introduced and a bio-inspired robotic manta ray propelled by two IPMC pectoral fins will be demonstrated. Fourth, a 2D maneuverable robotic fish propelled by multiple IPMC fin will be presented. Last, advantages and challenges of using IPMC artificial muscles in bio-inspired robots will be concluded.",
   "Counterbalancing of morphology and conductivity of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate based flexible devices.\nThe importance of conductive polymer electrodes with a balance between the morphology and electrical conductivity for flexible organic photovoltaic properties has been demonstrated. Highly transparent PEDOT:PSS anodes with controlled conductivity and surface properties were realized by insertion of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and a fluorosurfactant (Zonyl) as efficient additives and used for flexible organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) which are based on a bulk-heterojunction of polythieno[3,4-b]-thiophene-co-benzodithiophene (PTB7):[6,6]phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). We investigated the correlation between the electrical properties of PEDOT:PSS electrodes and their influences on the surface morphology of the active materials (PTB7:PC71BM). When the device was prepared from the PEDOT:PSS layer functioning as an anode of OPV through an optimized ratio of 5 vol% of DMSO and 0.1 wt% of fluorosurfactant, the devices exhibited improved fill factor (FF) due to the enhanced coverage of PEDOT:PSS films. These results correlate with reduced photoluminescence and increased charge extraction as seen through Raman spectroscopy and electrical analysis, respectively. The conductive polymer electrode with the balance between the morphology and electrical conductivity can be a useful replacement for brittle electrodes such as those made of indium tin oxide (ITO) as they are more resistant to cracking and bending conditions, which will contribute to the long-term operation of flexible devices.",
   "Indium tin oxide-free PEDOT:PSS/SAM/MoO3/Au/MoO3 multilayer electrodes for organic solar cells.\nA MoO3/Au/MoO3 (MAM) tri-layer structure was developed as a transparent, low-resistance anode for use in organic solar cells. Transmittance was maximized at 82% using symmetric bottom and top MoO3 layers (each of thickness 30 nm) either side of a 12 nm Au layer. Low sheet resistance also resulted (7.4 ohm per square). The series resistance and optical transmission of devices employing these structures as anodes were tailored by varying the thickness of the top MoO3 layer. Dissolution of the top MoO3 layer in",
   "Electrochemical determination of M. tuberculosis antigen based on Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) and functionalized carbon nanotubes hybrid platform.\nAn electrochemical DNA aptasensor for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) antigen MPT64, was developed using Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) doped with carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The biotinylated aptamer was immobilized onto streptavidin attached to -COOH functionalized CNTs via streptavidin-biotin interaction. Various characterization studies as FT-IR, FE-SEM, EIS and DPV were done to validate each fabrication step of the aptasensor. Optimization studies related to aptamer concentration and response time were performed. The electrochemical signal generated from the aptamer-target molecule interaction was monitored electrochemically by differential pulse voltammetry in the presence of [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- as a redox probe. The aptasensor exhibited limit of detection of 0.5\u00b10.2fgmL-1 within 15min with stability of 27 days at 4\u00b0C and reusability of 7 times after repeated regeneration with 50mM NaOH. The potential application of the aptasensor was established by spike-in studies to obtain recovery in between (88-95)%.",
   "Multifunctional structural energy storage composite supercapacitors.\nThis paper addresses the challenge of producing multifunctional composites that can simultaneously carry mechanical loads whilst storing (and delivering) electrical energy. The embodiment is a structural supercapacitor built around laminated structural carbon fibre (CF) fabrics. Each cell consists of two modified structural CF fabric electrodes, separated by a structural glass fibre fabric or polymer membrane, infused with a multifunctional polymeric electrolyte. Rather than using conventional activated carbon fibres, structural carbon fibres were treated to produce a mechanically robust, high surface area material, using a variety of methods, including direct etching, carbon nanotube sizing, and carbon nanotube in situ growth. One of the most promising approaches is to integrate a porous bicontinuous monolithic carbon aerogel (CAG) throughout the matrix. This nanostructured matrix both provides a dramatic increase in active surface area of the electrodes, and has the potential to address mechanical issues associated with matrix-dominated failures. The effect of the initial reaction mixture composition is assessed for both the CAG modified carbon fibre electrodes and resulting devices. A low temperature CAG modification of carbon fibres was evaluated using poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) to enhance the electrochemical performance. For the multifunctional structural electrolyte, simple crosslinked gels have been replaced with bicontinuous structural epoxy-ionic liquid hybrids that offer a much better balance between the conflicting demands of rigidity and molecular motion. The formation of both aerogel precursors and the multifunctional electrolyte are described, including the influence of key components, and the defining characteristics of the products. Working structural supercapacitor composite prototypes have been produced and characterised electrochemically. The effect of introducing the necessary multifunctional resin on the mechanical properties has also been assessed. Larger scale demonstrators have been produced including a full size car boot/trunk lid.",
   "Challenge beyond Graphene: Metal Oxide/Graphene/Metal Oxide Electrodes for Optoelectronic Devices.\nGraphene has shown strong potential to occupy transparent electrodes, replacing indium tin oxide (ITO). However, the commercialization of graphene is still limited because of its poor chemical and electrical stability from reaction with environmental factors or essential materials such as poly[3,4-(ethylenedioxy)thiophene]:poly(styrenesulfonate) (",
   "Highly conductive PEDOT:PSS treated with formic acid for ITO-free polymer solar cells.\nWe proposed a facile film treatment with formic acid to enhance the conductivity of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) by 4 orders of magnitude. The effect of formic acid concentration on conductivity was investigated; conductivity increased fast with increasing concentration up to 10 M and then increased slightly, the highest conductivity being 2050 S cm(-1) using 26 M concentration. Formic acid treated PEDOT:PSS films also exhibited very high transmittances. The mechanism of conductivity enhancement was explored through SEM, AFM, and XPS. Formic acid with its high dielectric constant screens the charge between PEDOT and PSS bringing about phase separation between them. Increased carrier concentration, removal of PSS from the film, morphology, and conformation change with elongated and better connected PEDOT chains are the main mechanisms of conductivity enhancement. ITO-free polymer solar cells were also fabricated using PEDOT:PSS electrodes treated with different concentrations of formic acid and showed equal performance to that of ITO electrodes. The concentrated acid treatment did not impair the desirable film properties as well as stability and performance of the solar cells.",
   "Glassy carbon electrodes modified with reduced graphene oxide-MoS2-poly (3, 4-ethylene dioxythiophene) nanocomposites for the non-enzymatic detection of nitrite in water and milk.\nThe detrimental effect of (NO2-) on environment, a sensitive and selective detection of nitrite (NO2-) ions with point-to-care device is need to be fabricated. Herein, we report the non-enzymatic nitrite sensor using a novel reduced graphene oxide/molybdenum disulfide/poly (3, 4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (rGO/MoS2/PEDOT) nanocomposite electrode. The rGO/MoS2/PEDOT nanocomposite was synthesized using facile and cost-effective hydrothermal and polymerization approaches. The characteristics of rGO-MoS2-PEDOT nanocomposite was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), Raman, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analyses. The rGO-MoS2-PEDOT nanocomposite modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was directly used for electrocatalytic detection of nitrite ions present in the solution. TEM images show the PEDOT nanoparticles with an average size of 100-120\u202fnm are uniformly covered on the outer face of rGO-MoS2 nanosheets. The interaction between the PEDOT and rGO-MoS2 is evidenced in the FTIR, XRD and XPS studies, and they produced synergistic effect, resulting enhanced electrocatalytic performance activity towards oxidation of nitrite. Under optimized conditions, the fabricated electrode exhibited remarkably good sensitivity (874.19\u202f\u03bcA\u202f\u03bcM-1\u202fcm-2), low detection limit (LOD) (0.059\u202f\u03bcM, S/N\u202f=\u202f3), wide linear range (0.001-1\u202fmM) of nitrite with desirable selectivity, long-term stability and reproducibility. Furthermore, the practical feasibility of the fabricated sensor is validated by the successful detection of nitrite ion in some water and milk samples with excellent correlation. Thus, feasible easier synthesis method was adopted first time to fabricate rGO-MoS2-PEDOT nanocomposite nitrite sensor in the milk and water samples with enhanced selectivity, sensitivity and LOD.",
   "Solution-processed PEDOT:PSS films with conductivities as indium tin oxide through a treatment with mild and weak organic acids.\nNew transparent conductive materials are urgently needed for optoelectronic devices. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) will be a promising next-generation transparent electrode material if its conductivity is comparable to that of indium tin oxide (ITO). To enhance significantly the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS with mild compounds has practical significance. In this work, significant conductivity enhancements are achieved on PEDOT:PSS films after treatment with mild and weak organic acids. The treated PEDOT:PSS films exibit metallic behavior at room temperature. Their conductivity increases to about 3300 S cm(-1) after they are treated with 8 M methanesulfonic acid. The conductivity enhancement depends on the acidity and physical properties of the organic acids. The mechanism for the conductivity enhancement is ascribed to proton transfer from the mild or weak organic acids to PSS(-) of PEDOT:PSS. There are two factors for the proton transfer from mild or weak organic acids to PSS. One factor is the high acid concentration during the treatment, particularly after the vaporization of the water solvent. Another factor is the phase segregation of PSSH from PEDOT:PSS, because PSSH is hydrophilic, whereas PEDOT is hydrophobic. This method is better than that using very strong and corrosive acids like sulfuric acid. These highly conductive and highly transparent PEDOT:PSS films are promising for use as next-generation transparent electrodes.",
   "Electrical Stimulation of NIH-3T3 Cells with Platinum-PEDOT-Electrodes Integrated in a Bioreactor.\nThe objective of this work involves the development and integration of electrodes for the electrical stimulation of cells within a bioreactor. Electrodes need to fit properties such as biocompatibility, large reversible charge transfer and high flexibility in view of their future application as implants on the tympanic membrane. Flexible thin-film platinum-poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene)-electrodes on a poly(ethylene terephthalate)-foil manufactured using microsystems technology were integrated into a bioreactor based on the design of a 24 well plate. The murine fibroblast cell line NIH-3T3 was cultured on the foil electrodes and the cells were stimulated with direct voltage and unipolar pulsed voltage. The amplitude, the pulse length and the ratio of pulse to pause were varied. The stimulated cells were stained in order to determine the angle between the cell cleavage plane of the dividing cells and the vector of the electric field. These angles were subsequently used to calculate the polarization index, which is a measure of the orientation of the metaphase plane of dividing cells that occurs for example during wound healing or embryonic morphogenesis.",
   "Conducting and Stretchable PEDOT:PSS Electrodes: Role of Additives on Self-Assembly, Morphology, and Transport.\nThe addition of dimethylsulfoxide and Zonyl into poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) can be combined to achieve excellent electrical, optical, and mechanical properties. We demonstrate that it is possible to produce highly transparent conducting electrodes (FoM > 35) with low Young's modulus and high carrier density. We investigated the relationship between the transport properties of PEDOT:PSS and the morphology and microstructure of these films by performing Hall effect measurement, atomic force microscopy, and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). Our analysis reveals the distinctive impact of the two additives on the PEDOT and PSS components in the solid-state PEDOT:PSS films. Both additives induce fibrillar formation in the film, and the combination of the two additives only enhances the fibrillary nature and the aggregations of both PEDOT and PSS components of the film. In situ GIWAXS allows to time-resolve the morphology evolution. Our analysis reveals the influence of additives on the aggregation and self-assembly behaviors of the PEDOT and PSS components. Aggregation occurs during the transition from wet to dry film, which is observed exclusively during the thermal annealing step of the as-cast hydrated film. These results indicate that the additives directly influence the self-assembly behaviors of PEDOT and PSS during the ink-to-solid phase transformation of the hydrated film, which occurs primarily during the initial seconds of post-deposition thermal annealing.",
   "A robust, highly stretchable supramolecular polymer conductive hydrogel with self-healability and thermo-processability.\nDual amide hydrogen bond crosslinked and strengthened high strength supramolecular polymer conductive hydrogels were fabricated by simply in situ doping poly (N-acryloyl glycinamide-co-2-acrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic) (PNAGA-PAMPS) hydrogels with PEDOT/PSS. The nonswellable conductive hydrogels in PBS demonstrated high mechanical performances-0.22-0.58\u2009MPa tensile strength, 1.02-7.62\u2009MPa compressive strength, and 817-1709% breaking strain. The doping of PEDOT/PSS could significantly improve the specific conductivities of the hydrogels. Cyclic heating and cooling could lead to reversible sol-gel transition and self-healability due to the dynamic breakup and reconstruction of hydrogen bonds. The mending hydrogels recovered not only the mechanical properties, but also conductivities very well. These supramolecular conductive hydrogels could be designed into arbitrary shapes with 3D printing technique, and further, printable electrode can be obtained by blending activated charcoal powder with PNAGA-PAMPS/PEDOT/PSS hydrogel under melting state. The fabricated supercapacitor via the conducting hydrogel electrodes possessed high capacitive performances. These cytocompatible conductive hydrogels have a great potential to be used as electro-active and electrical biomaterials.",
   "Improved photocurrent of a poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-ClO\u2084\u207b/TiO\u2082 thin film-modified counter electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells.\nWe prepared a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)-ClO\u2084\u207b-supported TiO\u2082 thin-film electrode as a counter electrode on a transparent conductive oxide glass electrode for a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) using a combination of sol-gel and electropolymerization methods. The photocurrent-voltage characteristics indicate that DSSCs with PEDOT-ClO\u2084\u207b/TiO\u2082 thin-film counter electrodes had a high photovoltaic conversion efficiency similar to that of PEDOT-ClO\u2084\u207b/TiO\u2082 particle composite-film electrodes. Furthermore, it was found that the photocurrent was increased by attaching a reflector to the opposite side of the transparent counter electrode.",
   "Organic photovoltaic cells with stable top metal electrodes modified with polyethylenimine.\nEfficient organic photovoltaic cells (OPV) often contain highly reactive low-work-function calcium electron-collecting electrodes. In this work, efficient OPV are demonstrated in which calcium electrodes were avoided by depositing a thin layer of the amine-containing nonconjugated polymer, polyethylenimine (PEIE), between the photoactive organic semiconductor layer and stable metal electrodes such as aluminum, silver, or gold. Devices with structure ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/poly(3-hexylthiophene):indene-C60-bis-adduct (P3HT:ICBA)/PEIE/Al demonstrated overall photovoltaic device performance comparable to devices containing calcium electron-collecting electrodes, ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:ICBA/Ca/Al, with open-circuit voltage of 775\u00b16 mV, short-circuit current density of 9.1\u00b10.5 mA cm(-2), fill factor of 0.65\u00b10.01, and power conversion efficiency of 4.6\u00b10.3%, averaged over 5 devices at 1 sun.",
   "An impedimetric molecularly-imprinted biosensor for Interleukin-1\u03b2 determination, prepared by in-situ electropolymerization on carbon screen-printed electrodes.\nThis work reports the first electrochemical molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) sensor for Interleukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2) detection, based on modified commercial screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) was successfully demonstrated. For this purpose, the carbon support was modified with a PEDOT/4-aminothiophenol layer prior to the MIP film to enhance sensitivity and signal stability. The MIP layer was constructed on top of this by electropolymerization of Eriochrome black T (EBT) in the presence of IL-1\u03b2. The several steps of the biosensor assembly was followed by Raman spectroscopy and electroanalytical techniques. Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), a linear response in the range of 60 pM to 600\u202fnM, with a LOD of 1.5 pM with (S/N\u202f=\u202f3) was obtained in neutral PBS. Selectivity tests of the MIP biosensor made in spiked synthetic serum samples as well as against other structurally related (Myoglobin, of similar shape and size) or competing compounds (Immunoglobulin G, also present in the human serum) confirmed the good selectivity of the biosensor. Overall, the biosensor described herein has the potential to provide a simple and quick way for on-site screening of IL-1\u03b2, with low sample/reagent consumption and enabling direct serum analysis, which constitutes a valuable alternative to other conventional methods.",
   "Solvent Treatment of Wet-Spun PEDOT: PSS Fibers for Fiber-Based Wearable pH Sensing.\nThere is a growing desire for wearable sensors in health applications. Fibers are inherently flexible and as such can be used as the electrodes of flexible sensors. Fiber-based electrodes are an ideal format to allow incorporation into fabrics and clothing and for use in wearable devices. Electrically conducting fibers were produced from a dispersion of poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly (styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS). Fibers were wet spun from two PEDOT: PSS sources, in three fiber diameters. The effect of three different chemical treatments on the fibers were investigated and compared. Short 5 min treatment times with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on 20 \u03bcm fibers produced from Clevios PH1000 were found to produce the best overall treatment. Up to a six-fold increase in electrical conductivity was achieved, reaching 800 S cm-1, with no loss of mechanical strength (150 MPa). With a pH-sensitive polyaniline coating, these fibers displayed a Nernstian response across a pH range of 3.0 to 7.0, which covers the physiologically critical pH range for skin. These results provide opportunities for future wearable, fiber-based sensors including real-time, on-body pH sensing to monitor skin disease.",
   "Gas sensing properties of single conducting polymer nanowires and the effect of temperature.\nWe measured the electronic properties and gas sensing responses of template-grown poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT/PSS)-based nanowires. The nanowires had a 'striped' structure (gold-PEDOT/PSS-gold), and were typically 8 microm long (1 microm-6 microm-1 microm for the sections, respectively) and 220 nm in diameter. Single-nanowire devices were contacted with pre-fabricated gold electrodes using dielectrophoretic assembly. A polymer conductivity of 11.5 +/- 0.7 S cm(-1) and a contact resistance of 27.6 +/- 4 kOmega were inferred from measurements on nanowires of varying length and diameter. The nanowire sensors detected a variety of odors, with rapid response and recovery (seconds). The response (DeltaR/R) varied as a power law with analyte concentration. The power law exponent was found to increase with the molecular weight of the analyte and as a function of temperature. The detection limits are set by noise intrinsic to the device and are at the ppm level even for very volatile analytes.",
   "Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-Poly(styrenesulfonate)-Coated Glassy-Carbon Electrode for Simultaneous Voltammetric Determination of Uranium and Plutonium in Fast-Breeder-Test-Reactor Fuel.\nUranium (U) and plutonium (Pu) contents in nuclear materials must be maintained to a definite level in order to get the desired performance of the fuel inside the reactor. Therefore, high accuracy and precision is an essential criterion for the determination of U and Pu. We already reported the voltammetric determination of Pu in the presence of U in fast-breeder-test-reactor (FBTR) fuel samples, but interfacial, coupled chemical reactions between U(IV) and Pu(IV) enhance the peak-current density of U(VI) reduction and thus make voltammetry unsuitable for the quantitative determination of U in the presence of Pu. Thus, developing a voltammetric method for the simultaneous determination of U and Pu is highly challenging. Herein, we report the simultaneous voltammetric determination of U and Pu in 1 M sulfuric acid (H2SO4) on a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS)-modified glassy-carbon (GC) electrode (PEDOT-PSS/GC). The modified electrode shows enhanced performance compared with bare GC electrodes. The peak-current density for U(VI) reduction is enhanced in the presence of Pu(IV), but it attains saturation when [Pu]/[U] in solution is maintained \u22652. Hence, under these circumstances, the variation of Pu concentration no longer influences the U(VI)-reduction peak, and thus the quantitative determination of U in the presence of Pu is possible. No interference is observed from commonly encountered impurities present in FBTR fuel samples. This method shows accuracy and precision comparable to those of the biamperometry method. High robustness, fast analysis, simultaneous determination, reduced radiation exposure to the analyst, and ease of recovery of U and Pu from analytical waste makes it a suitable candidate to substitute the presently applied biamperometry method.",

   "Polymerized hemin as an electrocatalytic platform for peroxynitrite's oxidation and detection.\nPeroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) constitutes a major cytotoxic agent, implicated in a host of pathophysiological conditions, thereby stimulating a tremendous interest in evaluating its role as an oxidant in vivo. Some of the detection methods for peroxynitrite include oxidation of fluorescent probes, EPR spectroscopy, chemiluminescence, immunohistochemistry, and probe nitration; however, these are more difficult to apply for real-time quantification due to their inherent complexity. The electrochemical detection of peroxynitrite is a simpler and more convenient technique, but the best of our knowledge there are only few papers to date studying its electrochemical signature, or reporting amperometric microsensors for peroxynitrite. Recently, we have reported the use of layered composite films of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and hemin (iron protoporphyrin IX) as a platform for amperometric measurement of peroxynitrite. The main goal herein is to investigate the intrinsic catalytic role of hemin electropolymerized thin films on carbon electrodes in oxidative detection of peroxynitrite. The electrocatalytic oxidation of peroxynitrite is characterized by cyclic voltammetry. The catalytic current increased as a function of peroxynitrite's concentration, with a peak potential shifting positively with peroxynitrite's concentration. The catalytic efficiency decreased as the scan rate increased, and the peak potential of the catalytic oxidation was found to depend on pH. We show that optimized hemin-functionalized carbon electrodes can be used as simple platforms for peroxinitrite detection and quantification. We report dose-response amperometry as an electroanalytical determination of this analyte on hemin films and we contrast the intrinsic hemin catalytic role with its performance in the case of the PEDOT-hemin as a composite matrix. Finally, we include some work extending the use of simple hemin films for peroxynitrite determination on carbon microfiber electrodes in a flow system.",
   "Enhancing mechanical properties of highly efficient polymer solar cells using size-tuned polymer nanoparticles.\nThe low mechanical durability of polymer solar cells (PSCs) has been considered as one of the critical hurdles for their commercialization. We described a facile and powerful strategy for enhancing the mechanical properties of PSCs while maintaining their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) by using monodispersed polystyrene nanoparticles (PS NPs). We prepared highly monodispersed, size-controlled PS NPs (60, 80, and 100 nm), and used them to modify the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) anode buffer layer (ABL). The PS NPs played two important roles; i.e., they served as (1) binders in the PEDOT:PSS films, and (2) interfacial modifiers between ABL and the active layer, resulting in remarkable improvement of the mechanical integrity of the PSCs. The addition of PS NPs enhanced the inherent mechanical toughness of the PEDOT:PSS ABL due to their elastic properties, allowing the modified ABL to tolerate higher mechanical deformations. In addition, the adhesion energy (Gc) between the active layer and the modified PEDOT:PSS layer was enhanced significantly, i.e., by a factor of more than 1.5. The Gc value has a strong relationship with the sizes of the PS NP, showing the greatest enhancement when the largest size PS NPs (100 nm) were used. In addition, PS NPs significantly improve the air-stability of the PSCs by suppressing moisture adsorption and corrosion of the electrodes. Thus, the modification of ABL with PS NPs effectively enhances both the mechanical and the long-term stabilities of the PSCs without sacrificing their PCE values, demonstrating their great potential as applications in flexible organic electronics.",
   "Inkjet-Printed Graphene/PEDOT:PSS Temperature Sensors on a Skin-Conformable Polyurethane Substrate.\nEpidermal electronic systems (EESs) are skin-like electronic systems, which can be used to measure several physiological parameters from the skin. This paper presents materials and a simple, straightforward fabrication process for skin-conformable inkjet-printed temperature sensors. Epidermal temperature sensors are already presented in some studies, but they are mainly fabricated using traditional photolithography processes. These traditional fabrication routes have several processing steps and they create a substantial amount of material waste. Hence utilizing printing processes, the EES may become attractive for disposable systems by decreasing the manufacturing costs and reducing the wasted materials. In this study, the sensors are fabricated with inkjet-printed graphene/PEDOT:PSS ink and the printing is done on top of a skin-conformable polyurethane plaster (adhesive bandage). Sensor characterization was conducted both in inert and ambient atmosphere and the graphene/PEDOT:PSS temperature sensors (thermistors) were able reach higher than 0.06% per degree Celsius sensitivity in an optimal environment exhibiting negative temperature dependence.",
   "High Performance of PEDOT:PSS/n-Si Solar Cells Based on Textured Surface with AgNWs Electrodes.\nHybrid heterojunction solar cells (HHSCs) have gained extensive research and attention due to simple device structure and low-cost technological processes. Here, HHSCs are presented based on a highly transparent conductive polymer poly(3,4ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)(PEDOT:PSS) directly spin-coated on an n-type crystalline silicon with microscale surface textures, which are prepared by traditional chemical etching. We have studied interface properties between PEDOT:PSS and textured n-Si by varying coating conditions. Final power conversion efficiency (PCE) could arrive at 8.54% by these simple solution-based fabrication processes. The high conversion efficiency is attributed to the fully conformal contact between PEDOT:PSS film and textured silicon. Furthermore, the reflectance of the PEDOT:PSS layer on textured surface is analyzed by changing film thickness. In order to improve the performance of the device, silver nanowires were employed as electrodes because of its better optical transmittance and electrical conductivity. The highest PCE of 11.07% was achieved which displayed a 29.6% enhancement compared with traditional silver electrodes. These findings imply that the combination of PEDOT:PSS film and silver nanowire transparent electrodes pave a promising way for realizing high-efficiency and low-cost solar cells.",
   "A highly sensitive electrochemical biosensor for catechol using conducting polymer reduced graphene oxide-metal oxide enzyme modified electrode.\nThe fabrication, characterization and analytical performances were investigated for a catechol biosensor, based on the PEDOT-rGO-Fe2O3-PPO composite modified glassy carbon (GC) electrode. The graphene oxide (GO) doped conducting polymer poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) was prepared through electrochemical polymerization by potential cycling. Reduction of PEDOT-GO was carried out by amperometric method. Fe2O3 nanoparticles were synthesized in ethanol by hydrothermal method. The mixture of Fe2O3, PPO and glutaraldehyde was casted on the PEDOT-rGO electrode. The surface morphology of the modified electrodes was studied by FE-SEM and AFM. Cyclic voltammetric studies of catechol on the enzyme modified electrode revealed higher reduction peak current. Determination of catechol was carried out successfully by Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV) technique. The fabricated biosensor investigated shows a maximum current response at pH 6.5. The catechol biosensor exhibited wide sensing linear range from 4\u00d710(-8) to 6.20\u00d710(-5)M, lower detection limit of 7\u00d710(-9)M, current maxima (Imax) of 92.55\u00b5A and Michaelis-Menten (Km) constant of 30.48\u00b5M. The activation energy (Ea) of enzyme electrode is 35.93KJmol(-1) at 50\u00b0C. There is no interference from d-glucose and l-glutamic acid, ascorbic acid and o-nitrophenol. The PEDOT-rGO-Fe2O3-PPO biosensor was stable for at least 75 days when stored in a buffer at about 4\u00b0C.",
   "Electrical performance of PEDOT:PSS-based textile electrodes for wearable ECG monitoring: a comparative study.\nWearable textile electrodes for the detection of biopotentials are a promising tool for the monitoring and early diagnosis of chronic diseases. We present a comparative study of the electrical characteristics of four textile electrodes manufactured from common fabrics treated with a conductive polymer, a commercial fabric, and disposable Ag/AgCl electrodes. These characteristics will allow identifying the performance of the materials when used as ECG electrodes. The electrodes were subjected to different electrical tests, and complemented with conductivity calculations and microscopic images to determine their feasibility in the detection of ECG signals.",
   "Specific Dopamine Sensing Based on Short-Term Plasticity Behavior of a Whole Organic Artificial Synapse.\nIn this work, we demonstrate the ultrasensitive and selective detection of dopamine by means of a neuro-inspired device platform without the need of a specific recognition moiety. The sensor is a whole organic device featuring two electrodes made of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate-PEDOT:PSS-patterned on a polydymethylsiloxane-PDMS-flexible substrate. One electrode is pulsed with a train of voltage square waves, to mimic the presynaptic neuron behavior, while the other is used to record the displacement current, mimicking the postsynaptic neuron. The current response exhibits the features of synaptic Short-Term Plasticity (STP) with facilitating or depressing response according to the stimulus frequency. We found that the response characteristic time \u03c5STP depends on dopamine (DA) concentration in solution. The dose curve exhibits superexponential sensitivity at the lowest concentrations below 1 nM. The sensor detects [DA] down to 1 pM range. We assess the sensor also in the presence of ascorbic acid (AA) and uric acid (UA). Our sensor does not respond to UA, but responds to AA only at concentration above 100 \u03bcM. However, it is still able to detect DA down to 1 pM range in the presence of [AA] = 100 \u03bcM and 100 pM in the presence of [UA] = 3 \u03bcM, these values for AA and UA being the physiological levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and the striatum, respectively.",
   "Bulk electronic transport impacts on electron transfer at conducting polymer electrode-electrolyte interfaces.\nElectrochemistry is an old but still flourishing field of research due to the importance of the efficiency and kinetics of electrochemical reactions in industrial processes and (bio-)electrochemical devices. The heterogeneous electron transfer from an electrode to a reactant in the solution has been well studied for metal, semiconductor, metal oxide, and carbon electrodes. For those electrode materials, there is little correlation between the electronic transport within the electrode material and the electron transfer occurring at the interface between the electrode and the solution. Here, we investigate the heterogeneous electron transfer between a conducting polymer electrode and a redox couple in an electrolyte. As a benchmark system, we use poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and the Ferro/ferricyanide redox couple in an aqueous electrolyte. We discovered a strong correlation between the electronic transport within the PEDOT electrode and the rate of electron transfer to the organometallic molecules in solution. We attribute this to a percolation-based charge transport within the polymer electrode directly involved in the electron transfer. We show the impact of this finding by optimizing an electrochemical thermogalvanic cell that transforms a heat flux into electrical power. The power generated by the cell increased by four orders of magnitude on changing the morphology and conductivity of the polymer electrode. As all conducting polymers are recognized to have percolation transport, we believe that this is a general phenomenon for this family of conductors.",
   "PEDOT Coated Thick Film Electrodes for In Situ Detection of Cell Adhesion in Cell Cultures.\nLow temperature cofired ceramics (LTCC) provide a technology for the 3-dimensional integration of sensor arrays into bioreactors covering dimensions of several hundred micrometers. Since optical control in such assemblies is not possible, the in situ detection of cell adhesion on impedance electrodes with high spatial resolution would deliver crucial information. A current limitation is the increasing impedance of microelectrodes with decreasing diameter. This study evaluates the suitability of thick film gold electrodes, pristine and coated with electropolymerized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), for the detection of cell adhesion on the electrode surface. The impedance as criterion for cell attachment is measured with a recording system for electroactive cells with the aim of improving usability. Two cell cultures with different adhesion characteristic are used for adhesion assessment on planar test chips. The impedance increase measured on individual PEDOT coated electrodes due to tight contact of cells reaches a factor of 6.8 in cultures of well-adherent HepG2 cells. Less adhered NG108-15 cells produce a maximum impedance increase by a factor of 2.6. Since the electrode impedance is significantly reduced by PEDOT coating, a reduction of the electrode diameter to values below 100 \u00b5m and spatially resolved detection is possible. The results encourage further studies using PEDOT coated thick film electrodes as bio-electronic-interfaces. We presume that such miniaturized electrodes are suitable for 3-dimensional recordings in electroactive cell cultures, providing information of local cell adhesion at the same time.",
   "Significant Lowering Optical Loss of Electrodes via using Conjugated Polyelectrolytes Interlayer for Organic Laser in Electrically Driven Device Configuration.\nOne of the challenges toward electrically driven organic lasers is the huge optical loss associated with the contact of electrodes and organic gain medium in device. We demonstrated a significant reduction of the optical loss by using our newly developed conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPE) PPFN(+)Br(-) as interlayer between gain medium and electrode. The optically pumped amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) was observed at very low threshold for PFO as optical gain medium and up to 37\u2009nm thick CPE as interlayer in device configuration, c.f., a 5.7-fold ASE threshold reduction from pump energy 150\u2009\u03bcJ/cm(2) for ITO/PFO to 26.3\u2009\u03bcJ/cm(2) for ITO/PPFN(+)Br(-)/PFO. Furthermore, ASE narrowing displayed at pump energy up to 61.8\u2009\u03bcJ/cm(2) for device ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PFO/PPFN(+)Br(-)/Ag, while no ASE was observed for the reference devices without CPE interlayer at pump energy up to 240\u2009\u03bcJ/cm(2). The optically pumped lasing operation has also been achieved at threshold up to 45\u2009\u03bcJ/cm(2) for one-dimensional distributed feedback laser fabricated on ITO etched grating in devices with CPE interlayer, demonstrating a promising device configuration for addressing the challenge of electrically driven organic lasers.",
   "Conducting polymer electrodes for visual prostheses.\nConducting polymers (CPs) have the potential to provide superior neural interfaces to conventional metal electrodes by introducing more efficient charge transfer across the same geometric area. In this study the conducting polymer poly(ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) was coated on platinum (Pt) microelectrode arrays. The in vitro electrical characteristics were assessed during biphasic stimulation regimes applied between electrode pairs. It was demonstrated that PEDOT could reduce the potential excursion at a Pt electrode interface by an order of magnitude. The charge injection limit of PEDOT was found to be 15 x larger than Pt. Additionally, PEDOT coated electrodes were acutely implanted in the suprachoroidal space of a cat retina. It was demonstrated that PEDOT coated electrodes also had lower potential excursions in vivo and electrically evoked potentials (EEPs) could be detected within the vision cortex.",
   "Improving the mass transport of copper-complex redox mediators in dye-sensitized solar cells by reducing the inter-electrode distance.\nIn this work, we study the influence of the distance between electrodes on the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells based on TiO2 using the organic dye LEG4 and a Cu(dmp)2 redox couple (dmp = dimethyl phenantroline). The solar cells are characterized by a large open circuit voltage of up to 1.03 V, and an efficiency of 8.2% has been achieved for a 5.3 \u03bcm thick TiO2 film using an epoxy resin-based sealed cell configuration with a minimal separation between electrodes. Transient short-circuit photocurrent measurements up to an intensity of 3 Suns show a significant decay in photocurrent after an initial peak current upon switching on the light for larger distance, resulting in a lower steady state photocurrent. For the smaller distance cells, the steady state photocurrent is linear with light intensity up to 2 Suns. Charge extraction measurements under short-circuit conditions show that reducing the distance between electrodes increases the electron collection efficiency and thus, the attainable photocurrent. Recombination losses increase with larger electrode separation distance and higher light intensity due to mass transport limitation of the redox mediator. Electrochemical impedance measurements confirm the effect of electrode distance on the redox couple transport, showing an additional loop with increasing distance. For the configuration where the TiO2 film is in very close proximity to the PEDOT-covered counter electrode, inductive behavior is observed at low frequencies. The inductive behavior disappears with the incorporation of an insulating porous ZrO2 layer. The equivalent circuit for the solar cell has been expanded to include this effect.",
   "Highly Deformable and See-Through Polymer Light-Emitting Diodes with All-Conducting-Polymer Electrodes.\nDespite the high expectation of deformable and see-through displays for future ubiquitous society, current light-emitting diodes (LEDs) fail to meet the desired mechanical and optical properties, mainly because of the fragile transparent conducting oxides and opaque metal electrodes. Here, by introducing a highly conductive nanofibrillated conducting polymer (CP) as both deformable transparent anode and cathode, ultraflexible and see-through polymer LEDs (PLEDs) are demonstrated. The CP-based PLEDs exhibit outstanding dual-side light-outcoupling performance with a high optical transmittance of 75% at a wavelength of 550 nm and with an excellent mechanical durability of 9% bending strain. Moreover, the CP-based PLEDs fabricated on 4 \u00b5m thick plastic foils with all-solution processing have extremely deformable and foldable light-emitting functionality. This approach is expected to open a new avenue for developing wearable and attachable transparent displays.",
   "Improving the performance of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) for brain-machine interface applications.\nConducting polymers, especially poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) based materials, are important for developing highly sensitive and microscale neural probes. In the present work, we show that the conductivity and stability of PEDOT can be significantly increased by switching the widely used counter anion poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) to the smaller tetrafluoroborate (TFB) anion during the electrodeposition of the polymer. Time-dependent impedance measurements of polymer modified implantable microwires were conducted in physiological buffer solutions under accelerated aging conditions and the relative stability of PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:TFB modified microwires was compared over time. This study was also extended to carbon nanotube (CNT) incorporated PEDOT:PSS which, according to some reports, is claimed to enhance the stability and electrical performance of the polymer. However, no noticeable difference was observed between PEDOT:PSS and CNT:PEDOT:PSS in our measurements. At the biologically relevant frequency of 1kHz, PEDOT:TFB modified microwires exhibit approximately one order of magnitude higher conductivity and demonstrate enhanced stability over both PEDOT:PSS and CNT:PEDOT:PSS modified microwires. In addition, PEDOT:TFB is not neurotoxic and we show the proof-of-concept for both in vitro and in vivo neuronal recordings using PEDOT:TFB modified microelectrode arrays and chronic electrodes, respectively. Our findings suggest that PEDOT:TFB is a promising conductive polymer coating for the recording of neural activities.",
   "Printed PEDOT:PSS Trilayer: Mechanism Evaluation and Application in Energy Storage.\nCombining ink-jet printing and one of the most stable electroactive materials, PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)), is envisaged to pave the way for the mass production of soft electroactive materials. Despite its being a well-known electroactive material, widespread application of PEDOT:PSS also requires good understanding of its response. However, agreement on the interpretation of the material's activities, notably regarding actuation, is not unanimous. Our goal in this work is to study the behavior of trilayers with PEDOT:PSS electrodes printed on either side of a semi-interpenetrated polymer network membrane in propylene carbonate solutions of three different electrolytes, and to compare their electroactive, actuation, and energy storage behavior. The balance of apparent faradaic and non-faradaic processes in each case is discussed. The results show that the primarily cation-dominated response of the trilayers in the three electrolytes is actually remarkably different, with some rather uncommon outcomes. The different balance of the apparent charging mechanisms makes it possible to clearly select one electrolyte for potential actuation and another for energy storage application scenarios.",
   "Multilayer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-dexamethasone and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrene sulfonate-carbon nanotubes coatings on glassy carbon microelectrode arrays for controlled drug release.\nThe authors present an electrochemically controlled, drug releasing neural interface composed of a glassy carbon (GC) microelectrode array combined with a multilayer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) coating. The system integrates the high stability of the GC electrode substrate, ideal for electrical stimulation and electrochemical detection of neurotransmitters, with the on-demand drug-releasing capabilities of PEDOT-dexamethasone compound, through a mechanically stable interlayer of PEDOT-polystyrene sulfonate (PSS)-carbon nanotubes (CNT). The authors demonstrate that such interlayer improves both the mechanical and electrochemical properties of the neural interface, when compared with a single PEDOT-dexamethasone coating. Moreover, the multilayer coating is able to withstand 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 biphasic pulses and delamination test with negligible change to the impedance spectra. Cross-section scanning electron microscopy images support that the PEDOT-PSS-CNT interlayer significantly improves the adhesion between the GC substrate and PEDOT-dexamethasone coating, showing no discontinuities between the three well-interconnected layers. Furthermore, the multilayer coating has superior electrochemical properties, in terms of impedance and charge transfer capabilities as compared to a single layer of either PEDOT coating or the GC substrate alone. The authors verified the drug releasing capabilities of the PEDOT-dexamethasone layer when integrated into the multilayer interface through repeated stimulation protocols in vitro, and found a pharmacologically relevant release of dexamethasone.",
   "Three-Dimensional Conductive Nanocomposites Based on Multiwalled Carbon Nanotube Networks and PEDOT:PSS as a Flexible Transparent Electrode for Optoelectronics.\nWe have synthesized conductive nanocomposites composed of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and Au nanoparticles (NPs). The Au NPs with an average size of approximately 4.3 nm are uniformly anchored on the MWCNT. After being exposed to microwave (MW) plasma irradiation, the anchored Au NPs melt and fuse, leading to larger aggregates (34 nm) that can connect the MWCNT forming a three-dimensional conducting network. The formation of a continuous MWCNT network can produce more a conductive pathway, leading to lower sheet resistance. When the Au-MWCNT is dispersed in the highly conductive polymer, poly(ethylene dioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (",
   "Electropolymerized Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) Coatings for Implantable Deep-Brain-Stimulating Microelectrodes.\nConducting polymers have been widely explored as coating materials for metal electrodes to improve neural signal recording and stimulation because of their mixed electronic-ionic conduction and biocompatibility. In particular, the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is one of the best candidates for biomedical applications due to its high conductivity and good electrochemical stability. Coating metal electrodes with PEDOT has shown to enhance the electrode's performance by decreasing the impedance and increasing the charge storage capacity. However, PEDOT-coated metal electrodes often have issues with delamination and stability, resulting in decreased device performance and lifetime. In this work, we were able to electropolymerize PEDOT coatings on sharp platinum-iridium recording and stimulating neural electrodes and demonstrated its mechanical and electrochemical stability. Electropolymerization of PEDOT:tetrafluoroborate was carried out in three different solvents: propylene carbonate, acetonitrile, and water. The stability of the coatings was assessed via ultrasonication, phosphate buffer solution soaking test, autoclave sterilization, and electrical pulsing. Coatings prepared with propylene carbonate or acetonitrile possessed excellent electrochemical stability and survived autoclave sterilization, prolonged soaking, and electrical stimulation without major changes in electrochemical properties. Stimulating microelectrodes were implanted in rats and stimulated daily, for 7 and 15 days. The electrochemical properties monitored in vivo demonstrated that the stimulation procedure for both coated and uncoated electrodes decreased the impedance.",
   "Electropolymerization on wireless electrodes towards conducting polymer microfibre networks.\nConducting polymers can be easily obtained by electrochemical oxidation of aromatic monomers on an electrode surface as a film state. To prepare conducting polymer fibres by electropolymerization, templates such as porous membranes are necessary in the conventional methods. Here we report the electropolymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene and its derivatives by alternating current (AC)-bipolar electrolysis. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) derivatives were found to propagate as a fibre form from the ends of Au wires used as bipolar electrodes (BPEs) parallel to an external electric field, without the use of templates. The effects of applied frequency and of the solvent on the morphology, growth rate and degree of branching of these PEDOT fibres were investigated. In addition, a chain-growth model for the formation of conductive material networks was also demonstrated.",
   "Synchrotron radiation/Fourier transform-infrared microspectroscopy study of undesirable water inclusions in solid-contact polymeric ion-selective electrodes.\nThis paper reports on three-dimensional synchrotron radiation/Fourier transform-infrared microspectroscopy (SR/FT-IRM) imaging studies of water inclusions at the buried interface of solid-contact-ion-selective electrodes (SC-ISEs). It is our intention to describe a nondestructive method that may be used in surface studies of the buried interfaces of materials, especially multilayers of polymers. Herein, we demonstrate the power of SR/FT-IRM for studying water inclusions at the buried interfaces of SC-ISEs. A poly(methyl methacrylate)-poly(decyl methacyrlate) [PMMA-PDMA] copolymer revealed the presence of micrometer sized inclusions of water at the gold/membrane interface, while a coupling of a hydrophobic solid contact of poly(3-octylthiophene 2,5-diyl) (POT) prevented the accumulation of water at the buried interface. A similar study with a poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly (styrenesulfonate) [PEDOT/PSS] solid contact also revealed an absence of distinct micrometer-sized pools of water; however, there were signs of absorption of water accompanied by swelling of the PEDOT/PSS underlayer, and these membrane zones are enriched with respect to water.",
   "Conducting polymer transistors making use of activated carbon gate electrodes.\nThe characteristics of the gate electrode have significant effects on the behavior of organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), which are intensively investigated for applications in the booming field of organic bioelectronics. In this work, high specific surface area activated carbon (AC) was used as gate electrode material in OECTs based on the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) doped with poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS). We found that the high specific capacitance of the AC gate electrodes leads to high drain-source current modulation in OECTs, while their intrinsic quasi-reference characteristics make unnecessary the presence of an additional reference electrode to monitor the OECT channel potential.",
   "Positively-charged hierarchical PEDOT interface with enhanced electrode kinetics for NADH-based biosensors.\nPoly(ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) has attracted considerable attention as an advanced electrode material for electrochemical sensors and biosensors, due to its unique electrical and physicochemical properties. Here, we demonstrate the facile preparation of a positively-charged and hierarchical micro-structured PEDOT electrochemical interface with enhanced electrode kinetics for the electrooxidation of NADH. Processable PEDOT colloidal microparticles (PEDOT CMs) were synthesised by template-assisted polymerisation and were then utilised as building blocks for the fabrication of hierarchically-structured electrodes with a larger accessible electroactive surface (2.8 times larger than that of the benchmark PEDOT:PSS) and inter-particle space, thus improving electrode kinetics. The intrinsic positive charge of the PEDOT CMs further facilitated the detection of negatively-charged molecules by electrostatic accumulation. Due to the synergistic effect, these hierarchically-structured PEDOT CMs electrodes exhibited improved NADH electrooxidation at lower potentials and enhanced electrocatalytic activity compared to the compact structure of conventional PEDOT:PSS electrodes. The PEDOT CMs electrodes detected NADH over the range of 20-240\u202f\u03bcM, with a sensitivity of 0.0156\u202f\u03bcA/\u03bcM and a limit of detection of 5.3\u202f\u03bcM. Moreover, the PEDOT CMs electrode exhibited a larger peak separation from the interferent ascorbic acid, and improved stability. This enhanced analytical performance for NADH provides a sound basis for further work coupling to a range of NAD-dependent dehydrogenases for applications in biosensing, bio-fuel cells and biocatalysis.",
   "Active Control of Dye Release for Neuronal Tracing Using PEDOT-PSS Coated Electrodes.\nPenetrating neural probes comprising arrays of microelectrodes are commonly used to monitor local field potentials and multi-unit activity in animal brain over time frames of weeks. To correlate these recorded signals to specific tissue areas, histological analysis is performed after the experimental endpoint. Even if the lesion of the penetrating probe shaft can be observed, a precise reconstruction of the exact electrode positions is still challenging. To overcome these experimental difficulties, we developed a new concept, whereupon recording electrodes are coated with a poly (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene/ polystyrenesulfonate) (PEDOT/PSS)-based film. The conducting polymer acts as dye reservoir over several weeks and afterwards provides controlled delivery of neurotracers. This paper presents a recording electrode based on a PEDOT/PSS bilayer optimized for dye delivery and with reduced impedance. Controlled exchange of neurotracer dye is successfully demonstrated in vitro using spectrofluorometry and in neuroblastoma cell cultures. A second PEDOT/PSS capping layer on top of the dye reservoir lowers the passive leakage of dye by a factor of 6.4 and prevents a direct contact of the dye filled layer with the cells. Stability tests over four weeks demonstrate the electrochemical stability of the PEDOT coating, as well as retained functionality of the dye delivery system.",
   "Solution-processed metallic conducting polymer films as transparent electrode of optoelectronic devices.\nThe conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films was significantly enhanced from 0.3 S cm(-1) to 3065 S cm(-1) through a treatment with dilute sulfuric acids. PEDOT:PSS films with a sheet resistance of 39 \u03a9 sq(-1) and transparency of around 80% at 550 nm are obtained. These PEDOT:PSS films with conductivity and transparency comparable to ITO can replace ITO as the transparent electrode of optoelectronic devices.",
   "A Novel Conductive Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-BSA Film for the Construction of a Durable HRP Biosensor Modified with NanoAu Particles.\nIn this study, we have investigated the contribution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) to the durability of the electrochemically synthesized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) film on a platinum (Pt) electrode. The electrode was capable to effectively adsorb the nano Au particles (AuNPs) to form a uniform layout, which was then able to immobilize the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to construct a functional HRP/AuNPs/PEDOT(BSA)/Pt biosensor. Cyclic voltammetry was employed to evaluate the performance of the biosensor through the measurement of hydrogen peroxide. Our results revealed a satisfied linear correlation between the cathodic current and the concentration of H2O2. Furthermore, the addition of oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or NAD\u207a, as the electron transfer mediator in the detection solution could dramatically enhance the sensitivity of detection by about 35.5%. The main advantages of the current biosensor are its durability, sensitivity, reliability, and biocompatibility.",
   "Tuning Surface Charge and Morphology for the Efficient Detection of Dopamine under the Interferences of Uric Acid, Ascorbic Acid, and Protein Adsorption.\nIn this research, we aimed to evaluate the impact of the surface charges and morphologies of electrodes on electrochemically detecting dopamine (DA) in the presence of protein adsorption, uric acid (UA), and ascorbic acid (AA). Through the electropolymerization of functionalized 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophenes (EDOT) directly on Au electrodes, we successfully created PEDOT-coated electrodes with three different functional groups and nanostructures. Negatively charged carboxylic acid groups attracted DA while reducing the interferences of UA and AA due to electrostatic effect. We used charge-free tetra(ethylene glycol) and zwitterionic phosphocholine groups are used to evaluate the interference of protein adsorption on DA sensing because they both can effectively prevent the nonspecific adsorption of proteins. These two electrodes can avoid protein adsorption, yet proved ineffective for DA sensing: both tetra(ethylene glycol) and the phosphocholine groups are electroneutral and have minimal electrostatic interactions with DA. We also used three proteins of different isoelectric points - bovine serum albumin, lysozyme, and fibrinogen - to evaluate the influence of protein adsorption on DA detection. We found that for an electrode coated with carboxylic acid-functionalized PEDOT, the adsorption of positively charged lysozyme can promote the detection sensitivity of AA and UA, and that all protein adsorption lowers the sensitivity of DA. In contrast, nanostructures promote the detection sensitivity of all three molecules. All of our tested functionalized PEDOT-coated electrodes demonstrated good stability and functionality in buffers.",
   "Nanostructured titanium nitride/PEDOT:PSS composite films as counter electrodes of dye-sensitized solar cells.\nThe composite films of titanium nitride in conjunction with polystyrenesulfonate-doped poly (3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) (PEDOT:PSS) were prepared by a simple mechanical mixture of TiN and PEDOT:PSS under ultrasonication, which was demonstrated to deliver an effectively combined network of both high electrical conductivity and superior electrocatalytic activity. The composite films have been explored as an alternative for the counter electrodes of dye-sensitized solar cells. It was manifested that these nanostructured TiN-PEDOT:PSS composite films displayed excellent performance comparable to Pt-FTO counter electrode due to the combined network endowing more favorable and efficient interfacial active sites. Among them, the energy conversion efficiency of the cell with TiN(P)-PEDOT:PSS as counter electrode reached 7.06%, which was superior to 6.57% of the cell with Pt-FTO counter electrode under the same experimental conditions.",
   "A stamped PEDOT:PSS-silicon nanowire hybrid solar cell.\nA novel stamped hybrid solar cell was proposed using the stamping transfer technique by stamping an active PEDOT:PSS thin layer onto the top of silicon nanowires (SiNWs). Compared to a bulk-type counterpart that fully embeds SiNWs inside PEDOT:PSS, an increase in the photovoltaic efficiency was observed by a factor of \u223c4.6, along with improvements in both electrical and optical responses for the stamped hybrid cell. Such improvements for hybrid cells was due to the formation of well-connected and linearly aligned active PEDOT:PSS channels at the top ends of the nanowires after the stamping process. These stamped channels facilitated not only to improve the charge transport, light absorption, but also to decrease the free carriers as well as exciton recombination losses for stamped hybrid solar cells.",
   "Flexible Polymer-on-Polymer Architecture for Piezo/Pyroelectric Energy Harvesting.\nAn all polymer piezo/pyroelectric device was fabricated using \u03b2 phase poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) as the active material and vapor phase polymerized (VPP) poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene) (PEDOT) as the flexible electrode overlay material. Inherent problems usually associated with coating polymeric electrodes onto the low surface energy PVDF were overcome by air plasma treating the film in conjunction with utilizing the VPP technique to simultaneously synthesize and in situ deposit the PEDOT electrode. Strain measurements up to the breaking-strain of PVDF (approximately 35%) indicated that the change in R/Ro was significantly smaller for the PEDOT based electrodes compared to the platinum electrode. Plasma treatment of the PVDF film increased the level of surface oxygenated carbon species that contributed to increased surface energy, as confirmed by confirmed by contact angle measurement. The enhanced adhesion between the two polymers layers contributed to a significant increase in the measured piezoelectric output voltage from 0.2 to 0.5 V for the same strain conditions. Pyroelectric voltage outputs were obtained by placing the film onto and off of a hotplate, for temperatures up to 50 \u00b0C above ambient. Finally, as a proof of concept, a simple energy harvesting device (plastic tube with slots for mounting multiple piezo/pyro films) was fabricated. The device was able to generate a usable level of peak output current (>3.5 \u03bcA) from human inhalation and exhalation \"waste energy\".",

   "Redox-Magnetohydrodynamically Controlled Fluid Flow with Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) Coupled to an Epitaxial Light Sheet Confocal Microscope for Image Cytometry Applications.\nWe present the merging of two technologies to perform continuous high-resolution fluorescence imaging of cellular suspensions in a deep microfluidics chamber with no moving parts. An epitaxial light sheet confocal microscope (e-LSCM) was used to image suspensions enabled by fluid transport via redox-magnetohydrodynamics (R-MHD). The e-LSCM features a linear solid state sensor, oriented perpendicular to the direction of flow, that can bin the emission across different numbers of pixels, yielding electronically adjustable optical sectioning. This, in addition to intensity thresholding, defines the axial resolution, which was validated with an optical phantom of polystyrene microspheres suspended in agarose. The linear fluid speed within the microfluidics chamber was uniform (0.16-2.9%) across the 0.5-1.0 mm lateral field of view (dependent upon the chosen magnification) with continuous acquisition. Also, the camera's linear exposure periods were controlled to ensure an accurate image aspect ratio across this span. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) was electrodeposited as an immobilized redox film on electrodes of a chip for R-MHD, and the fluid flow was calibrated to specific linear speeds as a function of applied current. Images of leukocytes stained with acridine orange, a fluorescent, amphipathic vital dye that intercalates DNA, were acquired in the R-MHD microfluidics chamber with the e-LSCM to demonstrate imaging of biological samples. The combination of these technologies provides a miniaturizable platform for large sample volumes and high-throughput, image-based analysis without the requirement of moving parts, enabling development of robust, point-of-care image cytometry.",
   "Equilibration Time of Solid Contact Ion-Selective Electrodes.\nPapers published on ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) generally report on the performance characteristics of these devices after long, extensive conditioning. Conditioning refers to the equilibration of the ion-selective electrode in an aqueous solution before the measurement of the sample. The requirement for long and repeated conditioning is a significant burden in a variety of applications, for example, single-use sensors aimed for in vivo or field applications and solid contact (SC) ISEs, which were developed to provide simple, mass-produced sensors that have the potential to be implemented without calibration and extensive conditioning. In this study we recorded the potential of SC K(+), Na(+), and H(+) ISEs as a function of time following their first contact with an aqueous electrolyte solution and used these transients to determine their equilibration times. The SC electrodes were built on Au, Pt, and glassy carbon (GC) substrates using galvanostatically deposited conductive polymer (PEDOT(PSS(-)), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrenesulfonate) as ion-to-electron transducer (solid internal contact) between the ion-selective membrane and the substrate. The SC electrodes built on GC and Au had significantly shorter equilibration times (between 5 and 13 min) than the SC electrodes built on Pt substrates (>60 min). Such significant differences in the equilibration times of SC ISEs built on different substrate electrodes are reported here for the first time. These unexpected findings suggest that the interface between the conductive polymer and the electron-conducting substrate (EC) has significant influence on the long-term dynamic behavior of SC ISEs.",
   "Three-Dimensional Flexible All-Organic Conductors for Multifunctional Wearable Applications.\nWearable textile electrodes based on \u03c0-conjugated polymers are appealing alternatives to carbon fabrics, conductive yarns, or metal wires because of their design flexibility, low cost, flexibility, and high throughput. This provides the benefits of both electronics and textiles. Herein, a general and new method has been developed to produce tailorable, wearable energy devices that are based on three-dimensional (3D) poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)-coated textile conductors. To obtain the desired electrode materials, both facile solution-dropping polymerization methods are used to fabricate a 3D flexible PEDOT conductor on a cotton textile (PEDOT/textile). PEDOT/textile shows a very low sheet resistance of 4.6-4.9 \u03a9\u00b7sq-1. Here, we employ the example of this 3D network-like structure and the excellent electrical conductivities under the large deformation of PEDOT/textiles to show that wearable and portable heaters have immense potential. A flexible textile heater with a large area (8 \u00d7 7.8 cm2) reached a saturation temperature of \u223c83.9 \u00b0C when a bias of 7 V was applied for \u223c70 s due to the good electrical conductivity of PEDOT. To demonstrate the performance of all-solid-state supercapacitors, nano-ascidian-like PEDOT (PEDOT-NA) arrays were prepared via a simple vapor-phase polymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene on PEDOT/textile to increase both the surface area and the number of ion diffusion paths. The PEDOT-NA arrays on PEDOT/textile showed outstanding performance with an areal capacitance of 563.3 mF\u00b7cm-2 at 0.4 mA\u00b7cm-2 and extraordinary mechanical flexibility. The maximum volumetric power density and energy density of the nanostructured PEDOT on the textile were 1.75 W\u00b7cm-3 and 0.0812 Wh\u00b7cm-3, respectively. It is expected that the wearable nanostructured conducting polymers will have advantages when used as structures for smart textronics and energy conversion/storage.",
   "Lead-Free Antimony-Based Light-Emitting Diodes through the Vapor-Anion-Exchange Method.\nHybrid lead halide perovskites continue to attract interest for use in optoelectronic devices such as solar cells and light-emitting diodes. Although challenging, the replacement of toxic lead in these systems is an active field of research. Recently, the use of trivalent metal cations (Bi3+ and Sb3+) that form defect perovskites A3B2X9 has received great attention for the development of solar cells, but their light-emissive properties have not previously been studied. Herein, an all-inorganic antimony-based two-dimensional perovskite, Cs3Sb2I9, was synthesized using the solution process. Vapor-anion-exchange method was employed to change the structural composition from Cs3Sb2I9 to Cs3Sb2Br9 or Cs3Sb2Cl9 by treating CsI/SbI3 spin-coated films with SbBr3 or SbCl3, respectively. This novel method facilitates the fabrication of Cs3Sb2Br9 or Cs3Sb2Cl9 through solution processing without the need of using poorly soluble precursors (e.g., CsCl and CsBr). We go on to demonstrate electroluminescence from a device employing Cs3Sb2I9 emitter sandwiched between ITO/PEDOT:PSS and TPBi/LiF/Al as the hole and electron injection electrodes, respectively. A visible-infrared radiance of 0.012 W\u00b7Sr-1\u00b7m-2 was measured at 6 V when Cs3Sb2I9 was the active emitter layer. These proof-of-principle devices suggest a viable path toward low-dimensional, lead-free A3B2X9 perovskite optoelectronics.",
   "Three-Dimensional Highly Stretchable Conductors from Elastic Fiber Mat with Conductive Polymer Coating.\nThe manufacture of stretchable conductors with well-reserved electrical performance under large-degree deformations via scalable processes remains of great importance. In this work, a highly stretchable 3D conductive framework consisting of a polyurethane fiber mat (PUF) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is reported through facile approaches, electrospinning, and in situ interfacial polymerization, which was then backfilled with poly(dimethylsiloxane) to obtain 3D conductors. The excellent stretchability of the 3D conductive network imparted the as-prepared electrode a superior mechanical durability. Moreover, the applied strains can be effectively accommodated by the arrangement and orientation of the fibers resulting in a relatively stable electrical performance with only a 20% increased resistance at 100% stretching. Meanwhile, the resistance of the conductor could remain constant during 2000 bending cycles and showed a slight increase during 100 cycles of 50% stretching. The potential in the applications of large-area stretchable electrodes was demonstrated by the construction of LED arrays with the PUF-based conductors as electrical connections.",
   "Detection of trace levels of organophosphate pesticides using an electronic tongue based on graphene hybrid nanocomposites.\nOrganophosphate (OP) compounds impose significant strains on public health, environmental/food safety and homeland security, once they have been widely used as pesticides and insecticides and also display potential to be employed as chemical warfare agents by terrorists. In this context, the development of sensitive and reliable chemical sensors that would allow in-situ measurements of such contaminants is highly pursued. Here we report on a free-enzyme impedimetric electronic tongue (e-tongue) used in the analysis of organophosphate pesticides comprising four sensing units based on graphene hybrid nanocomposites. The nanocomposites were prepared by reduction of graphene oxide in the presence of conducting polymers (PEDOT:PSS and polypyrrole) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), which were deposited by drop casting onto gold interdigitated electrodes. Impedance spectroscopy measurements were collected in triplicate for each sample analyzed, and the electrical resistance data were treated by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), revealing that the system was able to discriminate OPs at nanomolar concentrations. In addition, the electronic tongue system could detect OPs in real samples, where relations between the principal components and the variation of pesticides in a mixture were established, proving to be useful to analyze and monitor mixtures of OP pesticides. The materials employed provided sensing units with high specific surface area and high conductivity, yielding the development of a sensor with suitable stability, good reproducibility, and high sensitivity towards pesticide samples, being able to discriminate concentrations as low as 0.1nmolL-1. Our results indicate that the e-tongue system can be used as a rapid, simple and low cost alternative in the analyses of OPs pesticide solutions below the concentration range permitted by legislation of some countries.",
   "Surface Engineering of Graphene Composite Transparent Electrodes for High-Performance Flexible Triboelectric Nanogenerators and Self-Powered Sensors.\nHigh-performance transparent and flexible triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) based on graphene composite electrodes via surface engineering are proposed and demonstrated. Through modifying the CVD-grown graphene with the conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), composite electrodes with excellent optoelectronic performances were fabricated, which exhibited a high transmittance up to 83.5% and sheet resistance of 85 \u03a9/\u25a1, decreasing from the initial value of 725 \u03a9/\u25a1. As a consequence, the output current density and power of the corresponding TENG were enhanced by 140% to 2.4 \u03bcA/cm2 and by 118% to 12 \u03bcW, respectively, comparing with the counterpart composed of the pristine graphene electrodes. Furthermore, the composite electrode exhibited an outstanding durability of the physical and electrical characteristics after 10\u202f000 bending cycles and can be readily extended to a large area up to 100 cm2. Such flexible, transparent, stable TENGs pave the way for the application of self-powered body sensors due to their unique characteristics, such as portability, wearability, and human compatibility.",
   "Poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate)s as electrode modifiers for inverted organic electronics.\nWe demonstrate the use of poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (PSBMA), and its pyrene-containing copolymer, as solution-processable work function reducers for inverted organic electronic devices. A notable feature of PSBMA is its orthogonal solubility relative to solvents typically employed in the processing of organic semiconductors. A strong permanent dipole moment on the sulfobetaine moiety was calculated by density functional theory. PSBMA interlayers reduced the work function of metals, graphene, and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) by over 1 eV, and an ultrathin interlayer of PSBMA reduced the electron injection barrier between indium tin oxide (ITO) and C70 by 0.67 eV. As a result, the performance of organic photovoltaic devices with PSBMA interlayers is significantly improved, and enhanced electron injection is demonstrated in electron-only devices with ITO, PEDOT:PSS, and graphene electrodes. This work makes available a new class of dipole-rich, counterion-free, pH insensitive polymer interlayers with demonstrated effectiveness in inverted devices.",
   "Vapor-phase polymerization of poly(3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) nanofibers on carbon cloth as electrodes for flexible supercapacitors.\nIn this study, an evaporative vapor-phase polymerization approach was employed to fabricate vertically aligned poly(3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) nanofibers on the surface of carbon cloth (CC). Optimized reaction conditions can obtain well distributed and uniform layers of high-aspect-ratio PEDOT nanofibers on CC. The hierarchical PEDOT/CC structure as a freestanding electrode exhibits good electrochemical properties. As a flexible symmetric supercapacitor, the PEDOT/CC hybrid electrode displays a specific areal capacitance of 201.4 mF cm(-2) at 1 mA cm(-2), good flexibility with a higher value (204.6 mF cm(-2)) in the bending state, and a good cycling stability of 92.4% after 1000 cycles. Moreover, the device shows a maximum energy density of 4.0 Wh kg(-1) (with a power density of 3.2 kW kg(-1)) and a maximum power density of 4.2 kW kg(-1) (with an energy density of 3.1 Wh kg(-1)). The results demonstrate that PEDOT may be a promising material for storage devices through a simple and efficient vapor-phase polymerization process with precisely controlled reaction conditions.",
   "Counter Electrode Impact on Quantum Dot Solar Cell Efficiencies.\nThe counter electrode (CE), despite being as relevant as the photoanode in a quantum dot solar cell (QDSC), has hardly received the scientific attention it deserves. In this study, nine CEs (single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), tungsten oxide (WO3), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), copper sulfide (Cu2S), candle soot, functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (F-MWCNTs), reduced tungsten oxide (WO3-x), carbon fabric (C-Fabric), and C-Fabric/WO3-x) were prepared by using low-cost components and facile procedures. QDSCs were fabricated with a TiO2/CdS film which served as a common photoanode for all CEs. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) were 2.02, 2.1, 2.79, 2.88, 2.95, 3.78, 3.66, 3.96, and 4.6%, respectively, and the incident photon to current conversion efficiency response was also found to complement the PCE response. Among all CEs employed here, C-Fabric/WO3-x outperforms all the other CEs, for the synergy between C-Fabric and WO3-x comes to the fore during cell operation. The low sheet resistance of C-Fabric and its high surface area due to the meshlike morphology enables high WO3-x loading during electrodeposition, and the good electrocatalytic activity of WO3-x, the very low overpotential, and its high electrical conductivity that facilitate electron transfer to the electrolyte are responsible for the superior PCE. WO3-based electrodes have not been used until date in QDSCs; the ease of fabrication of WO3 films and their good chemical stability and scalability also favor their application to QDSCs. Futuristic possibilities for other novel composite CEs are also discussed. We anticipate this study to be useful for a well-rounded development of high-performance QDSCs.",
   "Ultrahigh electrical conductivity in solution-sheared polymeric transparent films.\nWith consumer electronics transitioning toward flexible products, there is a growing need for high-performance, mechanically robust, and inexpensive transparent conductors (TCs) for optoelectronic device integration.

   "Fully-Polymeric pH Sensor Realized by Means of a Single-Step Soft Embossing Technique.\nWe present here an electrochemical sensor microsystem for the monitoring of pH. The all-polymeric device is comprised of a cyclic olefin copolymer substrate, a 200 nm-thin patterned layer of conductive polymer (PEDOT), and a 70 nm electropolymerized layer of a pH sensitive conductive polymer (polyaniline). The patterning of the fluidic (microfluidic channels) and conductive (wiring and electrodes) functional elements was achieved with a single soft PDMS mold via a single embossing step process. A post-processing treatment with ethylene glycol assured the functional enhancement of the electrodes, as demonstrated via an electrical and electrochemical characterization. A surface modification of the electrodes was carried out, based on voltammetric electropolymerization, to obtain a thin layer of polyaniline. The mechanism for pH sensing is based on the redox reactions of the polyaniline layer caused by protonation. The sensing performance of the microsystem was finally validated by monitoring its potentiometric response upon exposure to a relevant range of pH.",
   "Self-powered and self-signalled autonomous electrochemical biosensor applied to cancinoembryonic antigen determination.\nThis work describes a novel and disruptive electrochemical biosensing device that is self-powered by light and self-signalled by an optical readout. Electrical energy requirements are ensured by a photovoltaic cell that is a dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC), in which one of the electrodes is the biosensing unit. The readout converts electrical energy into colour by an electrochromic cell and signals the concentration dependent event. This device was designed to target a cancer biomarker, cancinoembryonic antigen (CEA). In brief, the sensing unit was assembled on a conductive glass substrate with a highly conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) layer, using a molecularly-imprinted polymer of polypyrrol (PPy) as biorecognition element. This sensing unit acted as the counter electrode (CE) of the DSSC, generating a hybrid device with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 3.45% for a photoanode area of 0.7\u202fcm2. The hybrid DSSC/biosensor had an electrical output that was CEA concentration dependent from 100\u202fng/mL to 100 \u03bcg/mL, with a limit detection of 0.14\u202fng/mL in human urine samples. The electrochromic cell consisted of a PEDOT-based material and showed a colour gradient change for CEA concentrations, ranging from 0.1\u202fng/mL to 100 \u03bcg/mL. Overall, this self-powered and self-signalled set-up is equipment free and particularly suitable for point-of-care analysis (POC), being able to screen CEA in real samples and differentiating critical concentrations for establishing a diagnosis. It holds the potential to provide clinical relevant data anywhere, in a fully independent manner.",
   "Characterization of Tetrodes Coated with Au Nanoparticles (AuNPs) and PEDOT and Their Application to Thalamic Neural Signal Detection in vivo.\nTetrodes, consisting of four twisted micro-wires can simultaneously record the number of neurons in the brain. To improve the quality of neuronal activity detection, the tetrode tips should be modified to increase the surface area and lower the impedance properties. In this study, tetrode tips were modified by the electrodeposition of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) and dextran (Dex) doped poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). The electrochemical properties were measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). A decrease in the impedance value from 4.3 M\u03a9 to 13 k\u03a9 at 1 kHz was achieved by the modified tetrodes. The cathodic charge storage capacity (CSCC) of AuNPs-PEDOT deposited tetrodes was 4.5 mC/cm2, as determined by CV measurements. The tetrodes that were electroplated with AuNPs and PEDOT exhibited an increased surface area, which reduced the tetrode impedance. In vivo recording in the ventral posterior medial (VPM) nucleus of the thalamus was performed to investigate the single-unit activity in normal rats. To evaluate the recording performance of modified tetrodes, spontaneous spike signals were recorded. The values of the L-ratio, isolation distance and signal-to-noise (SNR) confirmed that electroplating the tetrode surface with AuNPs and PEDOT improved the recording performance, and these parameters could be used to effectively quantify the spikes of each cluster.",
   "Ionic Liquid Designed for PEDOT:PSS Conductivity Enhancement.\nPoly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene:polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is a water-processable conducting polymer with promise for use in transparent flexible electrodes and thermoelectric devices, but its conductivity is not satisfactory. Its low conductivity is attributed to the formation of hydrophilic/insulating PSS outer layers encapsulating the conducting/hydrophobic p-doped PEDOT cores. Recently a significant conductivity enhancement has been achieved by adding ionic liquid (IL). It is believed that ion exchange between PEDOT:PSS and IL components helps PEDOT to decouple from PSS and to grow into large-scale conducting domains, but the exact mechanism is still under debate. Here we show through free energy calculations using density functional theory on a minimal model that the most efficient IL pairs are the least tightly bound ones with the lowest binding energies, which would lead to the most efficient ion exchange with PEDOT:PSS. This spontaneous ion exchange followed by nanophase segregation between PEDOT and PSS, with formation of a \u03c0-stacked PEDOT aggregate decorated by IL anions, is also supported by molecular dynamics performed on larger PEDOT:PSS models in solution. We also show that the most efficient IL anions would sustain the highest amount of charge carriers uniformly distributed along the PEDOT backbone to further enhance the conductivity, providing that they remain in the PEDOT domain after the ion exchange. Hence, our design principle is that the high-performance IL should induce not only an efficient ion exchange with PEDOT:PSS to improve the PEDOT morphology (to increase mobility) but also a uniform high-level p-doping of PEDOT (to enhance intrinsic conductivity). Based on this principle, a promising (electron-withdrawing, but bulky, soft, and hydrophobic) new IL pair is proposed.",
   "One-Step Interface Engineering for All-Inkjet-Printed, All-Organic Components in Transparent, Flexible Transistors and Inverters: Polymer Binding.\nWe report a one-step interface engineering methodology which can be used on both polymer electrodes and gate dielectric for all-inkjet-printed, flexible, transparent organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) and inverters. Dimethylchlorosilane-terminated polystyrene (PS) was introduced as a surface modifier to cured poly(4-vinylphenol) dielectric and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) electrodes without any pretreatment. On the untreated and PS interlayer-treated dielectric and electrode surfaces, 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)pentacene was printed to fabricate OTFTs and inverters. With the benefit of the PS interlayer, the electrical properties of the OTFTs on a flexible plastic substrate were significantly improved, as shown by a field-effect mobility (\u03bcFET) of 0.27 cm2\u202fV-1\u202fs-1 and an on/off current ratio (Ion/Ioff) of greater than 106. In contrast, the untreated systems showed a low \u03bcFET of less than 0.02 cm2\u202fV-1\u202fs-1 and Ion/Ioff \u223c 104. Additionally, the all-inkjet-printed inverters based on the PS-modified surfaces exhibited a voltage gain of 7.17 V\u202fV-1. The all-organic-based TFTs and inverters, including deformable and transparent PEDOT:PSS electrodes with a sheet resistance of 160-250 \u03a9\u202fsq-1, exhibited a light transmittance of higher than 70% (at wavelength of 550 nm). Specifically, there was no significant degradation in the electrical performance of the interface engineering-assisted system after 1000 bending cycles at a radius of 5 mm.",
   "Laser Patterned Polymer/Carbon Nanotubes Composite Electrodes for Flexible Silicon Nanowire Transistors.\nFabrication techniques such as laser patterning offer excellent potential for low cost and large area device fabrication. Conductive polymers can be used to replace expensive metallic inks such as silver and gold nanoparticles for printing technology. Electrical conductivity of the polymers can be improved by blending with carbon nanotubes. In this work, formulations of acid functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (f-MWCNTs) and poly(ethylenedioxythiophene) [PEDOT]:polystyrene sulphonate [PSS] were processed, and thin films were prepared on plastic substrates. Conductivity of PEDOT:PSS increased almost four orders of magnitude after adding f-MWCNTs. Work function of PEDOT:PSS/f-MWCNTs films was \u223c0.5 eV higher as compared to the work function of pure PEDOT:PSS films, determined by Kelvin probe method. Field-effect transistors source-drain electrodes were prepared on PET plastic substrates where PEDOT:PSS/f-MWCNTs were patterned using laser ablation at 44 mJ/pulse energy to define 36 \u03bcm electrode separation. Silicon nanowires were deposited using dielectrophoresis alignment technique to bridge laser patterned electrodes. Top-gated nanowire field effect transistors were completed by depositing parylene C as polymer gate dielectric and gold as the top-gate electrode. Transistor characteristics showed p-type conduction with excellent gate electrode coupling, with an ON/OFF ratio of \u223c200. Thereby, we demonstrate the feasibility of using high workfunction, printable PEDOT:PSS/f-MWCNTs composite inks for laser patterned source/drain electrodes for nanowire transistors on flexible substrates.",

   "Retarding Ion Exchange between Conducting Polymers and Ionic Liquids for Printable Top Electrodes in Semitransparent Organic Solar Cells.\nSemitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs) are considered to be an influential tool for aesthetic and economic building-integrated photovoltaics, which can be fabricated by the printing technology. A poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and ionic liquid (IL) composite has been considered as an electrode for ST-OSCs because of its high electrical conductivity, high transparency, and printability. However, we found that the introduction of IL into the PEDOT:PSS solution for enhancing its electrical conductivity results in (1) nonreliable printing of PEDOT:PSS/IL composite films because of gradual gelation of the mixture solution and (2) the production of chemically reactive ion pairs during ion exchange between PSS and IL, which induces the oxidation of the underlying organic semiconductors during printing. To solve these problems, we developed a sequential printing method using pristine PEDOT:PSS and IL solutions to retard ion exchange, thus preventing chemical doping of organic semiconductors by newly generated ion pairs. Finally, by using only solution processes, we demonstrate efficient ST-OSCs with a printed PEDOT:PSS/IL composite as the top electrode, exhibiting a power conversion efficiency of 6.32% at an average visible transmittance of 35.4%.",
   "Stability of silver nanowire based electrodes under environmental and electrical stresses.\nFlexible transparent electrodes fabricated with random networks of silver nanowires (AgNWs) have been widely studied in recent years. This approach appears to be a promising alternative to replace ITO (indium tin oxide) in many optoelectronic applications. Many successful integrations in functional devices have already evidenced the high potential of this technology, but unfortunately only very few studies have been dedicated so far to the stability of this material. We present here a study dealing with the alteration of the electrical properties of AgNW meshes when subjected to different stresses. We demonstrate that AgNW electrodes are very stable when stored under ambient atmosphere up to, at least, two and a half years. Accelerated ageing processes also reveal that concentrated H2S or exposure to light does not cause any significant sheet resistance modification. However, the combination of high relative humidity and high temperature seems to be more critical. In addition, long lasting contact (two years) with PEDOT:PSS can induce deterioration of the electrical properties. Similarly, AgNW/PEDOT:PSS hybrid materials exhibit weaker stability under electrical stress when compared to pristine AgNW networks.",
   "Label-free microfluidic paper-based electrochemical aptasensor for ultrasensitive and simultaneous multiplexed detection of cancer biomarkers.\nSimultaneous detection of multiple tumor biomarkers in body fluids could facilitate early diagnosis of lung cancer, so as to provide scientific reference for clinical treatment. This paper depicted a multi-parameter paper-based electrochemical aptasensor for simultaneous detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in a clinical sample with high sensitivity and specificity. The paper-based device was fabricated through wax printing and screen-printing, which enabled functions of sample filtration and sample auto injection. Amino functional graphene (NG)-Thionin (THI)- gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and Prussian blue (PB)- poly (3,4- ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)- AuNPs nanocomposites were synthesized respectively. They were used to modify the working electrodes not only for promoting the electron transfer rate, but also for immobilization of the CEA and NSE aptamers. A label-free electrochemical method was adopted, enabling a rapid simple point-of-care testing. Experimental results showed that the proposed multi-parameter aptasensor exhibited good linearity in ranges of 0.01-500\u202fng\u202fmL-1 for CEA (R2\u202f=\u202f0.989) and 0.05-500\u202fng\u202fmL-1 for NSE (R2\u202f=\u202f0.944), respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) was 2\u202fpg\u202fmL-1 for CEA and 10\u202fpg\u202fmL-1 for NSE. In addition, the device was evaluated using clinical serum samples and received a good correlation with large electrochemical luminescence (ECL) equipment, which would offer a new platform for early cancer diagnostics, especially in those resource-limit areas.",
   "Tuning the gas sensing performance of single PEDOT nanowire devices.\nThis paper reports the synthesis and dopant dependent electrical and sensing properties of single poly(ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) nanowire sensors. Dopant type (i.e. polystyrenesulfonate (PSS(-)) and perchlorate (ClO(4)(-))) and solvent (i.e. acetonitrile and 1 : 1 water-acetonitrile mixture) were adjusted to change the conjugation length and hydrophilicity of nanowires which resulted in change of the electrical properties and sensing performance. Temperature dependent coefficient of resistance (TCR) indicated that the electrical properties are greatly dependent on dopants and electrolyte where greater disorder was found in PSS(-) doped PEDOT nanowires compared to ClO(4)(-) doped nanowires. Upon exposure to different analytes including water vapor and volatile organic compounds, these nanowire devices displayed substantially different sensing characteristics. ClO(4)(-) doped PEDOT nanowires from an acetonitrile bath show superior sensing responses toward less electronegative analytes and followed a power law dependence on the analyte concentration at high partial pressures. These tunable sensing properties were attributed to variation in the conjugation lengths, dopant type and concentration of the wires which may be attributed to two distinct sensing mechanisms: swelling within the bulk of the nanowire and work function modulation of Schottky barrier junction between nanowire and electrodes.",
   "A transparent, solvent-free laminated top electrode for perovskite solar cells.\nA simple lamination process of the top electrode for perovskite solar cells is demonstrated. The laminate electrode consists of a transparent and conductive plastic/metal mesh substrate, coated with an adhesive mixture of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate), PEDOT:PSS, and sorbitol. The laminate electrode showed a high degree of transparency of 85%. Best cell performance was achieved for laminate electrodes prepared with a sorbitol concentration of ~30 wt% per milliliter PEDOT:PSS dispersion, and using a pre-annealing temperature of 120\u00b0C for 10 min before lamination. Thereby, perovskite solar cells with stabilized power conversion efficiencies of (7.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0)% were obtained which corresponds to 80% of the reference devices with reflective opaque gold electrodes.",
   "Polydopamine-doped conductive polymer microelectrodes for neural recording and stimulation.\nMicroelectrodes have been widely used to detect and modulate the activities of neuronal networks. Various materials have been applied to microelectrode fabrication, and the conductive polymer is one of the most intensively explored material. The properties of conductive polymer highly depend on the incorporated material, so selecting it is essential. The mussel-inspired biomolecule, polydopamine (pDA), is known to provide unique chemical and mechanical properties to biological interfaces. NEW METHOD: pDA was incorporated into poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) resulting in polydopamine PEDOT hybrid (PEDOT/pDA) microelectrode by an electrochemical deposition method. The electrical properties, such as impedance, charge storage capacity (CSC), and charge injection limit (CIL), of PEDOT/pDA microelectrodes, were characterized.",
   "Validation of Polymer-Based Screen-Printed Textile Electrodes for Surface EMG Detection.\nIn recent years, the variety of textile electrodes developed for electrophysiological signal detection has increased rapidly. Among the applications that could benefit from this advancement, those based on surface electromyography (sEMG) are particularly relevant in rehabilitation, training, and muscle function assessment. In this work, we validate the performance of polymer-based screen-printed textile electrodes for sEMG signal detection. We obtained these electrodes by depositing poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene doped with poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) onto cotton fabric, and then selectively changing the physical properties of the textile substrate. The manufacturing costs are low and this process meets the requirements of textile-industry production lines. The validation of these electrodes was based on their functional and electrical characteristics, assessed for two different electrode sizes and three skin-interface conditions (dry, solid hydrogel, or saline solution), and compared to those of conventional disposable gelled electrodes. Results show high similarity in terms of noise amplitude and electrode-skin impedance between the conventional and textile electrodes with the addition of solid hydrogel or saline solution. Furthermore, we compared the shape of the electrically induced sEMG, as detected by conventional and textile electrodes from tibialis anterior. The comparison yielded an [Formula: see text] value higher than 97% for all measurement conditions. Preliminary tests in dynamic conditions (walking) revealed the exploitability of the proposed electrode technology with saline application for the monitoring of sEMG for up to 35 min of activity. These results suggest that the proposed screen-printed textile electrodes may be an effective alternative to the conventional gelled electrodes for sEMG acquisition, thereby providing new opportunities in clinical and wellness fields.",
   "Ultra-small carbon fiber electrode recording site optimization and improved in vivo chronic recording yield.\nCarbon fiber electrodes may enable better long-term brain implants, minimizing the tissue response commonly seen with silicon-based electrodes. The small diameter fiber may enable high-channel count brain-machine interfaces capable of reproducing dexterous movements. Past carbon fiber electrodes exhibited both high fidelity single unit recordings and a healthy neuronal population immediately adjacent to the recording site. However, the recording yield of our carbon fiber arrays chronically implanted in the brain typically hovered around 30%, for previously unknown reasons. In this paper we investigated fabrication process modifications aimed at increasing recording yield and longevity.",
   "Aligned Conducting Polymer Nanotubes for Neural Prostheses.\nThe long-term performance of neural microelectrodes relies on biocompatibility and sensitivity of the electrode-tissue interface. Current neural electrodes are limited by poor electrical performance including high initial impedance and low charge storage capacity. In addition, they are mechanically hard which causes cellular reactive response to the implanted electrode. In this report, we have demonstrated a new templating method for fabrication of highly aligned conducting polymer nanotube. The structure of nanotubes can be precisely modulated by varying the time of electropolymerization. The electrical performance of poly(pyrrole) (PPY) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophine) (PEDOT) nanotubes including impedance and charge storage capacity were studied and compared as the surface morphology and structure of nanotube varied during the fabrication process. PEDOT nanotubes were found to have lower impedance than PPY nanotubes. By contrast, PPY nanotubes were shown to have higher charge storage capacity. These finding suggest that aligned conducting polymer nanotubes may enhance the long-term performance of neural microelectrodes.",
   "Scaling Organic Electrochemical Transistors Down to Nanosized Channels.\nThe perspective of downscaling organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) in the nanorange is approached by depositing poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) on electrodes with a nanogap designed and fabricated by electromigration induced break junction (EIBJ) technique. The electrical response of the fabricated devices is obtained by acquiring transfer characteristics in order to clarify the specific main characteristics of OECTs with sub-micrometer-sized active channels (nanogap-OECTs). On the basis of their electrical response to different scan times, the nanogap-OECT shows a maximum transconductance unaffected upon changing scan times in the time window from 1 s to 100 \u00b5s, meaning that fast varying signals can be easily acquired with unchanged amplifying performance. Hence, the scaling down of the channel size to the nanometer scale leads to a geometrical paradigm that minimizes effects on device response due to the cationic diffusion into the polymeric channel. A comprehensive study of these features is carried out by an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) study, complemented by a quantitative analysis made by equivalent circuits. The propagation of a redox front into the polymer bulk due to ionic diffusion also known as the \"intercalation pseudocapacitance\" is identified as a limiting factor for the transduction dynamics.",
   "Conducting-polymer nanotubes improve electrical properties, mechanical adhesion, neural attachment, and neurite outgrowth of neural electrodes.\nAn in vitro comparison of conducting-polymer nanotubes of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and poly(pyrrole) (PPy) and to their film counterparts is reported. Impedance, charge-capacity density (CCD), tendency towards delamination, and neurite outgrowth are compared. For the same deposition charge density, PPy films and nanotubes grow relatively faster vertically, while PEDOT films and nanotubes grow more laterally. For the same deposition charge density (1.44 C cm(-2)), PPy nanotubes and PEDOT nanotubes have lower impedance (19.5 +/- 2.1 kOmega for PPy nanotubes and 2.5 +/- 1.4 kOmega for PEDOT nanotubes at 1 kHz) and higher CCD (184 +/- 5.3 mC cm(-2) for PPy nanotubes and 392 +/- 6.2 mC cm(-2) for PEDOT nanotubes) compared to their film counterparts. However, PEDOT nanotubes decrease the impedance of neural-electrode sites by about two orders of magnitude (bare iridium 468.8 +/- 13.3 kOmega at 1 kHz) and increase capacity of charge density by about three orders of magnitude (bare iridium 0.1 +/- 0.5 mC cm(-2)). During cyclic voltammetry measurements, both PPy and PEDOT nanotubes remain adherent on the surface of the silicon dioxide while PPy and PEDOT films delaminate. In experiments of primary neurons with conducting-polymer nanotubes, cultured dorsal root ganglion explants remain more intact and exhibit longer neurites (1400 +/- 95 microm for PPy nanotubes and 2100 +/- 150 microm for PEDOT nanotubes) than their film counterparts.

   "Organic solar cells using CVD-grown graphene electrodes.\nWe report on the development of flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) incorporating graphene sheets synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) as transparent conducting electrodes on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates. A key barrier that must be overcome for the successful fabrication of OSCs with graphene electrodes is the poor-film properties of water-based poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) when coated onto hydrophobic graphene surfaces. To form a uniform PEDOT:PSS film on a graphene surface, we added perfluorinated ionomers (PFI) to pristine PEDOT:PSS to create 'GraHEL', which we then successfully spin coated onto the graphene surface. We systematically investigated the effect of number of layers in layer-by-layer stacked graphene anode of an OSC on the performance parameters including the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF). As the number of graphene layers increased, the FF tended to increase owing to lower sheet resistance, while Jsc tended to decrease owing to the lower light absorption. In light of this trade-off between sheet resistance and transmittance, we determined that three-layer graphene (3LG) represents the best configuration for obtaining the optimal power conversion efficiency (PCE) in OSC anodes, even at suboptimal sheet resistances. We finally developed efficient, flexible OSCs with a PCE of 4.33%, which is the highest efficiency attained so far by an OSC with CVD-grown graphene electrodes to the best of our knowledge.",
   "Scanning electrochemical microscopy imaging of poly (3,4-ethylendioxythiophene)/thionine electrodes for lactate detection via NADH electrocatalysis.\nHerein we report the use of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) together with electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques to develop and characterise a stable and uniformly reactive chemically modified platinum electrode for NADH electrocatalysis. In order to achieve this, a range of different approaches for thionine entrapment within an electropolymerised poly (3,4-ethylendioxythiophene) (PEDOT) film were evaluated using SECM imaging in the presence of NADH, demonstrating the uniformity of the reactive layer towards NADH oxidation. The effect of electrolyte type and time scale employed during PEDOT electropolymerisation was examined with respect to thionine loading and the resulting charge transport diffusion coefficient (DCT) estimated via chronoamperometry. These studies indicated a decrease in DCT as thionine loading increased within the PEDOT film, suggesting that charge transport was diffusion limited within the film. Additionally, thionine functionalised nanotubes were formed, providing a stable support for lactate dehydrogenase entrapment while lowering the rate of thionine leaching, determined via SECM imaging. This enabled lactate determination at Eapp\u202f=\u202f0.0\u202fV vs Ag/AgCl over the range 0.25-5\u202fmM in the presence of 1\u202fmM NAD+.",

   "High efficiency of poly(3-hexylthiophene)/[6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester bulk heterojunction solar cells through precrystallining of poly(3-hexylthiophene) based layer.\nAn facile approach for improving device efficiency of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/[6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) bulk heterojunction solar cells is presented. This method is used by simply precasting a tiny thin P3HT layer with high crystallinity between PEDOT:PSS and photoactive P3HT:PC61BM layers. The high crystalline thin P3HT layers are casted from three different solvents such as dichloromethane (DCM), dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), and tetrahydrofuran (THF). It is demonstrated that THF used for thin P3HT layer preparation is a suitable solvent for yielding a high crystalline film, which is unreadily washed away during the solution processing of the active layer. The results indicate that the morphology of P3HT:PC61BM active layers strongly depend on the formation of P3HT buffer layer. A great morphology difference of P3HT:PC61BM is caused from crystallinity of P3HT buffer layers prepared by different solvents. The thin P3HT layer with high crystallinity can improve the crystalline degree of P3HT in the active layer, subsequently inducing the whole active layer to form a well self-assembled pathway for efficient charge transfer and transportation to their respective electrodes. Therefore, a dramatically enhanced short-circuit current density of the device is resulted. After optimization of thickness of the P3HT buffer layer, an improvement of the power conversion efficiency is obtained from 2.98% to 5.14%.",
   "Elucidating the impact of molecular packing and device architecture on the performance of nanostructured perylene diimide solar cells.\nThe performance of organic photovoltaic devices (OPV) with nanostructured polymer:perylene diimide (PDI) photoactive layers approaches the levels of the corresponding polymer:fullerene systems. Nevertheless, a coherent understanding of the difficulty for PDI-based OPV devices to deliver high power conversion efficiencies remains elusive. Here we perform a comparative study of a set of four different polymer:PDI OPV model systems. The different device performances observed are attributed to differences in the nanostructural motif of these composites, as determined by wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) measurements. Long-range structural order in the PDI domain dictates (i) the stabilization energy and (ii) the concentration of the PDI excimers in the composites. The quenching of the PDI excimer photoluminescence (PL) is found to be insensitive to the former, but it depends on the latter. High PL quenching occurs for the low concentration of PDI excimers that are formed in PDI columns with a length comparable to the PDI excimer diffusion length. The stabilization of the PDI excimer state increases as the long-range order in the PDI domains improves. The structural order of the PDI domains primarily affects charge transport. Electron mobility reduces as the size of the PDI domain increases, suggesting that well-ordered PDI domains suffer from poor electronic connectivity. WAXS further reveals the presence of additional intermolecular PDI interactions, other than the direct face-to-face intermolecular coupling, that introduce a substantial energetic disorder in the polymer:PDI composites. Conventional device architectures with hole-collecting ITO/PEDOT:PSS bottom electrodes are compared with inverted device architectures bearing bottom electron-collecting electrodes of ITO/ZnO. In all cases the ZnO-functionalized devices surpass the performance of the conventional device analogues. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy explains that in",
   "Simultaneously enhanced optical, electrical, and mechanical properties of highly stretchable transparent silver nanowire electrodes using organic surface modifier.\nWe report on a new surface modifier which simultaneously improves electrical, optical, and mechanical properties of silver nanowire-based stretchable transparent electrodes. The transparent electrodes treated with 11-aminoundecanoic acid achieve a low sheet resistance of 26.0\u00a0ohm/sq and a high transmittance of 90% with an excellent stretchability. These improvements are attributed to the effective formation of a strong chemical bond between silver nanowire networks and elastomeric substrates by 11-aminoundecanoic acid treatment. The resistance change of the optimized silver nanowire/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) thin-films is only about 10% when the film is stretched by 120%. In addition, the chemical stability of stretchable silver nanowire films is significantly improved by the introduction of conductive PEDOT:PSS overcoat film. The optimized electrodes are utilized as high-performance stretchable transparent heaters, successfully illustrating its feasibility for future wearable electronics.",
   "Package-free flexible organic solar cells with graphene top electrodes.\nPackage-free flexible organic solar cells are fabricated with multilayer graphene as top transparent electrodes, which show the highest power conversion efficiency of about 3.2% and excellent flexibility and bending stability.

   "Electrocatalysis of 2,5-dimercapto-1,3,5-thiadiazole by 3,4-ethylenedioxy-substituted conducting polymers.\nThe electronic properties of electropolymerized films of the 3,4-ethylenedioxy-substituted conducting polymers (CP) poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxypyrrole) (PEDOP) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxyselenophene) (PEDOS) have been investigated, along with their electrocatalytic activity toward 2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole (DMcT). For the electropolymerized films, the conductivity onset potential was most negative for PEDOP (-1.50 V), followed by PEDOS (-1.35 V) and with PEDOT possessing the most positive onset (-1.15 V). The heterogeneous charge transfer rate constant for DMcT in solution at polymer-film-modified glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs) was studied. It was found that compared to PEDOP, both PEDOS and PEDOT performed better as electrocatalysts, with PEDOS having a heterogeneous charge transfer rate constant of 1.8 \u00d7 10(-3) cm/s. The film morphology of the electropolymerized films was investigated via SEM, and some film characteristics could be correlated with electrocatalytic activity. The potential use of CP/DMcT composites for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) is discussed.",
   "Investigation of near ohmic behavior for poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): a model consistent with systematic variations in polymerization conditions.\nThe impedance behavior of semiconducting polymer film electrodes based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) in combination with a series of anionic dopants has been investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) over the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. Films were electrodeposited on gold-coated Pt wire electrodes from a nonaqueous solution containing 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT). EIS results reveal that, under the optimal synthesis conditions, PEDOT electrodes consistently exhibit low, frequency-independent impedance over a wide frequency range (from \u223c10 Hz to 100 kHz). These results suggest that the behavior originates from the two-layer homogeneous morphology of the film. A model for conduction in the films that is supported by experimental evidence is proposed, and EIS data for electrodes produced under a variety of electropolymerization conditions are presented.",
   "Tyramine detection using PEDOT:PSS/AuNPs/1-methyl-4-mercaptopyridine modified screen-printed carbon electrode with molecularly imprinted polymer solid phase extraction.\nTyramine (4-hydroxyphenethylamine), which is a monoamine metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO), exists widely in plants, animals, fermented foods, and salted foods. The incidence of hypertension, or \"cheese effect\", which is associated with a large dietary intake of tyramine while taking MAO inhibitors has been reported; therefore, the measurement of tyramine is an urgent concern. Herein, an efficient approach that integrates a molecular imprinting polymer for solid phase extraction (MISPE) technique with a sensitive electrochemical sensing platform (SPCE/PEDOT: PSS/AuNP/1-m-4-MP) for the quantification of tyramine is presented. Enhanced electrode conductivity was achieved sequentially by constructing a conductive polymer (PEDOT: PSS) on a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE), followed by electrodeposition with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and, finally, by modification with positively charged 1-methyl-4-mercaptopyridine (1-m-4-MP) using an Au-S bond. Tyramine was isolated selectively and pre-concentrated by the MISPE technique; electroanalysis that used differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in NaOH (0.1M, pH 13) was conducted successively. Experimental parameters (such as modes of electrode modification, ratio of PEDOT: PSS, pH of electrolyte, time required for AuNP deposition, and 1-m-4-MP concentrations) that were associated with optimal detection conditions were evaluated also. We obtained a linear concentration range (5-100nM, R2=0.9939) with LOD and sensitivity at 2.31nM, and 3.11\u03bcAnM-1cm-2, respectively. The applicability of our technique was demonstrated by analyzing tyramine in spiked serum and milk. The feature of our newly developed analytical methods that coupled sample pre-treatment (sample clean-up and pre-concentration) with sensitive detection makes it a promising tool for quantifying of tyramine.",
   "Ultrafine sulfur nanoparticles in conducting polymer shell as cathode materials for high performance lithium/sulfur batteries.\nWe report the synthesis of ultrafine S nanoparticles with diameter 10 ~ 20 nm via a membrane-assisted precipitation technique. The S nanoparticles were then coated with conducting poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) to form S/PEDOT core/shell nanoparticles. The ultrasmall size of S nanoparticles facilitates the electrical conduction and improves sulfur utilization. The encapsulation of conducting PEDOT shell restricts the polysulfides diffusion, alleviates self-discharging and the shuttle effect, and thus enhances the cycling stability. The resulting S/PEDOT core/shell nanoparticles show initial discharge capacity of 1117 mAh g(-1) and a stable capacity of 930 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles.",
   "Conductive conjugated polyelectrolyte as hole-transporting layer for organic bulk heterojunction solar cells.\nPoly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has been extensively used as the hole-transporting layer (HTL) in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, however, its anisotropic electrical conduction and intrinsic acidic nature generally limit the device performance. Here we demonstrate the application of a water/alcohol soluble CPE (CPE-K) as HTLs in BHJ solar cells, achieving a PCE up to 8.2%. The more superior and uniform vertical electrical conductivity found in CPE-K reduces the series resistance and provides efficient hole extraction.",
   "Molecular junctions of self-assembled monolayers with conducting polymer contacts.\nWe present a method to fabricate individually addressable junctions of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) that builds on previous studies which have shown that soft conductive polymer top contacts virtually eliminate shorts through the SAMs. We demonstrate devices with nanoscale lateral dimensions, representing an order of magnitude reduction in device area, with high yield and relatively low device-to-device variation, improving several features of previous soft contact devices. The devices are formed in pores in an inorganic dielectric layer with features defined by e-beam lithography and dry etching. We replace the aqueous PEDOT:PSS conductive polymer used in prior devices with Aedotron P, a low-viscosity, amphiphilic polymer, allowing incorporation of self-assembled monolayers with either hydrophobic or hydrophilic termination with the same junction geometry and materials. We demonstrate the adaptability of this new design by presenting transport measurements on SAMs composed of alkanethiols with methyl, thiol, carboxyl, and azide terminations. We establish that the observed room-temperature tunnel barrier is primarily a function of monolayer thickness, independent of the terminal group's hydrophilicity. Finally, we investigate the temperature dependence of transport and show that the low-temperature behavior is based on the energy distribution of sites from which carriers can tunnel between the polymer and gold contacts, as described by a model of variable-range hopping transport in a disordered conductor.",
   "Highly conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxypyrrole) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) enwrapped Sb2S3 nanorods for flexible supercapacitors.\nComposites of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxypyrrole) or PEDOP and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) or PEDOT enwrapped Sb2S3 nanorods have been synthesized for the first time for use as supercapacitor electrodes. Hydrothermally synthesized Sb2S3 nanorods, several microns in length and 50-150 nm wide, offer high surface area and serve as a scaffold for coating conducting polymers, and are a viable alternative to carbon nanostructures. Fibrillar morphologies are achieved for the PEDOP-Sb2S3 and PEDOT-Sb2S3 films in contrast to the regular granular topologies attained for the neat polymers. The remarkably high nanoscale (\u223c5 S cm(-1)) conductivity of the Sb2S3 nanorods enables facile electron transport in the composites. We constructed asymmetric supercapacitors using the neat polymer or composite and graphite as electrodes. High specific capacitances of 1008 F g(-1) and 830 F g(-1) (at 1 A g(-1)), enhanced power densities (504 and 415 W kg(-1)) and excellent cycling stability (88 and 85% capacitance retention at the end of 1000 cycles) are delivered by the PEDOP-Sb2S3 and PEDOT-Sb2S3 cells relative to the neat polymer cells. A demonstration of a light emitting diode illumination using a light-weight, flexible, supercapacitor fabricated with PEDOP-Sb2S3 and carbon-fiber cloth shows the applicability of Sb2S3 enwrapped conducting polymers as sustainable electrodes for ultra-thin supercapacitors.",
   "Electrode materials, thermal annealing sequences, and lateral/vertical phase separation of polymer solar cells from multiscale molecular simulations.\nThe nanomorphologies of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layer of polymer solar cells are extremely sensitive to the electrode materials and thermal annealing conditions. In this work, the correlations of electrode materials, thermal annealing sequences, and resultant BHJ nanomorphological details of P3HT:PCBM BHJ polymer solar cell are studied by a series of large-scale, coarse-grained (CG) molecular simulations of system comprised of PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Al layers. Simulations are performed for various configurations of electrode materials as well as processing temperature. The complex CG molecular data are characterized using a novel extension of our graph-based framework to quantify morphology and establish a link between morphology and processing conditions. Our analysis indicates that vertical phase segregation of P3HT:PCBM blend strongly depends on the electrode material and thermal annealing schedule. A thin P3HT-rich film is formed on the top, regardless of bottom electrode material, when the BHJ layer is exposed to the free surface during thermal annealing. In addition, preferential segregation of P3HT chains and PCBM molecules toward PEDOT:PSS and Al electrodes, respectively, is observed. Detailed morphology analysis indicated that, surprisingly, vertical phase segregation does not affect the connectivity of donor/acceptor domains with respective electrodes. However, the formation of P3HT/PCBM depletion zones next to the P3HT/PCBM-rich zones can be a potential bottleneck for electron/hole transport due to increase in transport pathway length. Analysis in terms of fraction of intra- and interchain charge transports revealed that processing schedule affects the average vertical orientation of polymer chains, which may be crucial for enhanced charge transport, nongeminate recombination, and charge collection. The present study establishes a more detailed link between processing and morphology by combining multiscale molecular simulation framework with an extensive morphology feature analysis, providing a quantitative means for process optimization.",
   "Electroanalysis of As(III) at nanodendritic Pd on PEDOT.\nNanodendritic Pd electrodeposited on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) modified Pd nanodendrite electrodes has been studied for electroanalysis of As(III) in 1 M HCl solution. The Pd nanodendrites are grown on a porous thin film of PEDOT by electrodeposition process. Pd-PEDOT/C electrodes are characterized by physicochemical and electrochemical studies. Cyclic voltammetry studies show that Pd-PEDOT/C electrodes exhibit greater electrocatalytic activity towards As(iii)/As(0) redox reaction than the Pd/C electrodes. Differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV) is performed for analysis of As(iii) ion at pH 1.0. The Pd-PEDOT/C electrode is highly sensitive towards As(III) detection with sensitivity of 1482 \u03bcA cm(-2) \u03bcM(-1). A wide detection range up to 10 \u03bcM and low detection limit of 7 nM (0.52 ppb) are obtained with a pre-deposition time of 120 s under optimum conditions. High sensitivity and low detection limit obtained on Pd-PEDOT/C, for the first time in the literature, are attractive from a practical view point. Interference studies of Cu(II) ions are investigated and it is observed that Cu(II) ions do not interfere.",
   "Solution-Processed Interfacial PEDOT:PSS Assembly into Porous Tungsten Molybdenum Oxide Nanocomposite Films for Electrochromic Applications.\nElectrochromic devices (ECDs) have received increased attention for applications including optoelectronics, smart windows, and low-emission displays. However, it has been recognized that the ECDs with transition-metal oxide (TMO) electrodes possess a high charge transport barrier because of their poor electrical conductivity, which limits their electrochromic performance. In this work, we addressed this limitation by utilizing a conjugated polymer to fabricate an organic-inorganic nanocomposite film that decreases the charge transport barrier of typical TMO electrodes. Using a conventional spray-layer-by-layer (spray-LbL) deposition technique, we demonstrate an electrochromic film composed of porous layers of tungsten molybdenum oxide (W0.71Mo0.29O3) nanorods permeated with an interconnected conductive layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). The introduction of PEDOT:PSS is shown to significantly reduce the charge transport barrier, allowing the nanocomposite W0.71Mo0.29O3/PEDOT:PSS electrode to exhibit significantly improved electrochromic switching kinetics compared with the deposited W0.71Mo0.29O3 films. Furthermore, the optical contrast of the nanocomposite electrode was observed to be superior to both pure PEDOT:PSS and W0.71Mo0.29O3 electrodes, with a performance that exceeded the linearly predicted contrast of combining the pure films by 23%. The enhanced performance of the PEDOT:PSS-intercalated porous W0.71Mo0.29O3 nanocomposite electrodes and the facile synthesis through a spray-LbL method demonstrate a viable strategy for preparing fast assembling high-performance nanocomposite electrodes for a wide variety of electrochemical devices.",
   "Cl-/SO32--Codoped Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) That Interpenetrates and Encapsulates Porous Fe2O3 To Form Composite Nanoframeworks for Stable Lithium-Ion Batteries.\nPenetrating into the inner surface of porous metal-oxide nanostructures to encapsulate the conductive layer is an efficient but challenging route to exploit high-performance lithium-ion battery electrodes. Furthermore, if the bonding force on the interface between the core and shell was enhanced, the structure and cyclic performance of the electrodes will be greatly improved. Here, vertically aligned interpenetrating encapsulation composite nanoframeworks were assembled from Cl-/SO32--codoped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) that interpenetrated and coated on porous Fe2O3 nanoframeworks (PEDOT-IE-Fe2O3) via a one-step Fe3+-induced in situ growth strategy. Compared with conventional wrapped structures and methods, the special PEDOT-IE-Fe2O3 encapsulation structure has many advantages. First, the codoped PEDOT shell ensures a high conductive network in the composites (100.6 S cm-1) and provides interpenetrating fast ion/electron transport pathways on the inner and outer surface of a single composite unit. Additionally, the pores inside offer void space to buffer the volume expansion of the nanoscale frameworks in cycling processes. In particular, the formation of Fe-S bonds on the organic-inorganic interface (between PEDOT shell and Fe2O3 core) enhances the structural stability and further extends the cell cycle life. The PEDOT-IE-Fe2O3 was applied as lithium-ion battery anodes, which exhibit excellent lithium storage capability and cycling stability. The capacity was as high as 1096 mA h g-1 at 0.05 A g-1, excellent rate capability, and a long and stable cycle process with a capacity retention of 89% (791 mA h g-1) after 1000 cycles (2 A g-1). We demonstrate a novel interpenetrating encapsulation structure to highly enhance the electrochemical performance of metal-oxide nanostructures, especially the cycling stability, and provide new insights for designing electrochemical energy storage materials.",
   "Electrochemical Impedance Analysis of a PEDOT:PSS-Based Textile Energy Storage Device.\nA textile-based energy storage device with electroactive PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(4-styrenesulfonate)) polymer functioning as a solid-state polyelectrolyte has been developed. The device was fabricated on textile fabric with two plies of stainless-steel electroconductive yarn as the electrodes. In this study, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance analysis were used to investigate ionic and electronic activities in the bulk of PEDOT:PSS and at its interfaces with stainless steel yarn electrodes. The complex behavior of ionic and electronic origins was observed in the interfacial region between the conductive polymer and the electrodes. The migration and diffusion of the ions involved were confirmed by the presence of the Warburg element with a phase shift of 45\u00b0 (n = 0.5). Two different equivalent circuit models were found by simulating the model with the experimental results: (QR)(QR)(QR) for uncharged and (QR)(QR)(Q(RW)) for charged samples. The analyses also showed that the further the distance between electrodes, the lower the capacitance of the cell. The distribution of polymer on the cell surface also played important role to change the capacitance of the device. The results of this work may lead to a better understanding of the mechanism and how to improve the performance of the device.",
   "Micro-patterned films of bio-functionalized conducting polymers for cellular engineering.\nConducting polymers (CPs) are easy to process and have tunable physical and chemical properties including conductivity, volume, color, and hydrophobicity. Therefore, these organic polymers are attractive in a broad spectrum of bioelectronic applications ranging from implantable electrodes to biosensors and actuators. Patterned films of CPs, especially with various surface chemistries, provide versatile and sophisticated building-blocks for bioelectronics. In this context, we recently introduced a simple and efficient technique of hydrogel-mediated electropolymerization to directly pattern films of PPy (polypyrrole) with spatially-addressable chemistries. This technique employs a topographically patterned hydrogel stamp to deliver polymer precursors to the surface of electrode during the PPy electropolymerization. This method enables easy incorporation of different molecules into CP film during the polymerization. Herein, we aim to extend the scope of hydrogel-mediated electropolymerization to pattern other types of CPs and to explore the potential of bio-functionalized CP films for cell adhesion studies. Using this method, patterned films of two distinct CPs, PPy and PEDOT, were generated with a number of dopants. The produced films were characterized for morphology, impedance, and chemical composition. Patterned CP films were bio-functionalized by incorporation of a laminin peptide into these films. Lastly, the resultant substrates were tested for cell adhesion where laminin-doped CP showed a higher level of cell adhesion compared to PSS (polystyrene sulfonate)-doped CP films. These results together demonstrate the potential application of patterned films of bio-functionalized CPs for cellular engineering.",
   "Electrochemical Behavior of PEDOT/Lignin in Ionic Liquid Electrolytes: Suitable Cathode/Electrolyte System for Sodium Batteries.\nBiomass-derived polymers, such as lignin, contain quinone/ hydroquinone redox moieties that can be used to store charge. Composites based on the biopolymer lignin and several conjugated polymers have shown good charge-storage properties. However, their performance has been only studied in acidic aqueous media limiting their applications mainly to supercapacitors. Here, we show that PEDOT/lignin (PEDOT: poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)) biopolymers are electroactive in aprotic ionic liquids (ILs) and we move a step further by assembling sodium full cell batteries using PEDOT/lignin as electrode material and IL electrolytes. Thus, the electrochemical activity and cycling of PEDOT/lignin electrodes was investigated in 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BMPyrTFSI), 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (BMPyrFSI), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMImTFSI) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (EMImFSI) IL electrolytes. The effects of water and sodium salt addition to the ILs were investigated to obtain optimum electrolyte systems for sodium batteries. Finally, sodium batteries based on PEDOT/lignin cathode with imidazolium-based IL electrolyte showed higher capacity values than pyrrolidinium ones, reaching 70 mAhg-1 . Our results demonstrate that PEDOT/lignin composites can serve as low cost and sustainable cathode materials for sodium batteries.",
   "Inorganic/organic hybrid solar cells: optimal carrier transport in vertically aligned silicon nanowire arrays.\nInorganic/organic hybrid radial heterojunction solar cells that combine vertically-aligned n-type silicon nanowires (SiNWs) with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) have great potential for replacing commercial Si solar cells. The chief advantage of such solar cells is that they exhibit higher absorbance for a given thickness than commercial Si solar cells, due to incident light-trapping within the NW arrays, thus enabling lower-cost solar cell production. We report herein on the effects of NW length, annealing and surface electrode on the device performance of SiNW/PEDOT:PSS hybrid radial heterojunction solar cells. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the obtained SiNW/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells can be optimized by tuning the thickness of the surface electrode, and the etching conditions during NW formation and post-annealing. The PCE of 9.3% is obtained by forming efficient transport pathways for photogenerated charge carriers to electrodes. Our approach is a significant contribution to design of high-performance and low-cost inorganic/organic hybrid heterojunction solar cells.",
   "Inference of perceptual priors from path dynamics of passive self-motion.\nThe monitoring of one's own spatial orientation depends on the ability to estimate successive self-motion cues accurately. This process has become to be known as path integration. A feature of sequential cue estimation, in general, is that the history of previously experienced stimuli, or priors, biases perception. Here, we investigate how during angular path integration, the prior imparted by the displacement path dynamics affects the translation of vestibular sensations into perceptual estimates. Subjects received successive whole-body yaw rotations and were instructed to report their position within a virtual scene after each rotation. The overall movement trajectory either followed a parabolic path or was devoid of explicit dynamics. In the latter case, estimates were biased toward the average stimulus prior and were well captured by an optimal Bayesian estimator model fit to the data. However, the use of parabolic paths reduced perceptual uncertainty, and a decrease of the average size of bias and thus the weight of the average stimulus prior were observed over time. The produced estimates were, in fact, better accounted for by a model where a prediction of rotation magnitude is inferred from the underlying path dynamics on each trial. Therefore, when passively displaced, we seem to be able to build, over time, from sequential vestibular measurements an internal model of the vehicle's movement dynamics. Our findings suggest that in ecological conditions, vestibular afference can be internally predicted, even when self-motion is not actively generated by the observer, thereby augmenting both the accuracy and precision of displacement perception.",
   "Neuroprosthetics in amputee and brain injury rehabilitation.\nThe goals of rehabilitation medicine programs are to promote health, restore functional impairments and improve quality of life. The field of neuroprosthetics has evolved over the last decade given an improved understanding of neuroscience and the incorporation of advanced biotechnology and neuroengineering in the rehabilitation setting to develop adaptable applications to help facilitate recovery for individuals with amputations and brain injury. These applications may include a simple cognitive prosthetics aid for impaired memory in brain-injured individuals to myoelectric prosthetics arms with artificial proprioceptive feedback for those with upper extremity amputations. The integration of neuroprosthetics into the existing framework of current rehabilitation approaches not only improves quality-of-care and outcomes but help broadens current rehabilitation treatment paradigms. Although, we are in the infancy of the understanding the true benefit of neuroprosthetics and its clinical applications in the rehabilitation setting there is tremendous amount of promise for future research and development of tools to help facilitate recovery and improve quality of life in individuals with disabilities.",
   "Constant RMS versus constant peak modulation for the perceptual equivalence of sinusoidal amplitude modulated signals.\nNeuroprosthetics using intracortical microstimulation can potentially alleviate sensory deprivation due to injury or disease. However the information bandwidth of a single microstimulation channel remains largely unanswered. This paper presents three experiments that examine the importance of Peak Power/Charge and RMS Power/Charge for detection of acoustic and electrical Sinusoidal Amplitude Modulated stimuli by the auditory system. While the peripheral auditory system is sensitive to RMS power cues for the detection of acoustic stimuli, here we provide results that suggest that the auditory cortex is sensitive to peak charge cues for electrical stimuli. Varying the modulation frequency and depth do not change this effect for detection of modulated electrical stimuli.",
   "Action Monitoring Cortical Activity Coupled to Submovements.\nNumerous studies have examined neural correlates of the human brain's action-monitoring system during experimentally segmented tasks. However, it remains unknown how such a system operates during continuous motor output when no experimental time marker is available (such as button presses or stimulus onset). We set out to investigate the electrophysiological correlates of action monitoring when hand position has to be repeatedly monitored and corrected. For this, we recorded high-density electroencephalography (EEG) during a visuomotor tracking task during which participants had to follow a target with the mouse cursor along a visible trajectory. By decomposing hand kinematics into naturally occurring periodic submovements, we found an event-related potential (ERP) time-locked to these submovements and localized in a sensorimotor cortical network comprising the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the precentral gyrus. Critically, the amplitude of the ERP correlated with the deviation of the cursor, 110 ms before the submovement. Control analyses showed that this correlation was truly due to the cursor deviation and not to differences in submovement kinematics or to the visual content of the task. The ERP closely resembled those found in response to mismatch events in typical cognitive neuroscience experiments. Our results demonstrate the existence of a cortical process in the SMA, evaluating hand position in synchrony with submovements. These findings suggest a functional role of submovements in a sensorimotor loop of periodic monitoring and correction and generalize previous results from the field of action monitoring to cases where action has to be repeatedly monitored.",
   "Improving Cross-Day EEG-Based Emotion Classification Using Robust Principal Component Analysis.\nConstructing a robust emotion-aware analytical framework using non-invasively recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has gained intensive attentions nowadays. However, as deploying a laboratory-oriented proof-of-concept study toward real-world applications, researchers are now facing an ecological challenge that the EEG patterns recorded in real life substantially change across days (i.e., day-to-day variability), arguably making the pre-defined predictive model vulnerable to the given EEG signals of a separate day. The present work addressed how to mitigate the inter-day EEG variability of emotional responses with an attempt to facilitate cross-day emotion classification, which was less concerned in the literature. This study proposed a robust principal component analysis (RPCA)-based signal filtering strategy and validated its neurophysiological validity and machine-learning practicability on a binary emotion classification task (happiness vs. sadness) using a five-day EEG dataset of 12 subjects when participated in a music-listening task. The empirical results showed that the RPCA-decomposed sparse signals (RPCA-S) enabled filtering off the background EEG activity that contributed more to the inter-day variability, and predominately captured the EEG oscillations of emotional responses that behaved relatively consistent along days. Through applying a realistic add-day-in classification validation scheme, the RPCA-S progressively exploited more informative features (from 12.67 \u00b1 5.99 to 20.83 \u00b1 7.18) and improved the cross-day binary emotion-classification accuracy (from 58.31 \u00b1 12.33% to 64.03 \u00b1 8.40%) as trained the EEG signals from one to four recording days and tested against one unseen subsequent day. The original EEG features (prior to RPCA processing) neither achieved the cross-day classification (the accuracy was around chance level) nor replicated the encouraging improvement due to the inter-day EEG variability. This result demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method and may shed some light on developing a realistic emotion-classification analytical framework alleviating day-to-day variability.",
   "Conducting polymer electrodes for auditory brainstem implants.\nThe auditory brainstem implant (ABI) restores hearing in patients with damaged auditory nerves. One of the main ideas to improve the efficacy of ABIs is to increase spatial specificity of stimulation, in order to minimize extra-auditory side-effects and to maximize the tonotopy of stimulation. This study reports on the development of a microfabricated conformable electrode array with small (100 \u03bcm diameter) electrode sites. The latter are coated with a conducting polymer, PEDOT:PSS, to offer high charge injection properties and to safely stimulate the auditory system with small stimulation sites. We report on the design and fabrication of the polymer implant, and characterize the coatings in physiological conditions in vitro and under mechanical deformation. We characterize the coating electrochemically and during bending tests. We present a proof of principle experiment where the auditory system is efficiently activated by the flexible polymeric interface in a rat model. These results demonstrate the potential of using conducting polymer coatings on small electrode sites for electrochemically safe and efficient stimulation of the central auditory system.",
   "Nobel Prize centenary: Robert B\u00e1r\u00e1ny and the vestibular system.\nThe hundredth anniversary of Robert B\u00e1r\u00e1ny's Nobel Prize in Medicine offers the opportunity to highlight the importance of his discoveries on the physiology and pathophysiology of the vestibular organs. B\u00e1r\u00e1ny developed the method of caloric vestibular stimulation that revolutionized the investigation of the semicircular canals and that is still widely used today. Caloric vestibular stimulation launched experimental vestibular research that was relevant to comprehend the evolution of human locomotion, and B\u00e1r\u00e1ny's tests continue to be used in neuroscience to understand the influence of vestibular signals on bodily perceptions, cognition and emotions. Only during the last 20 years has caloric vestibular stimulation been merged with brain imaging to localize the human vestibular cortex.",
   "Applying dimension reduction to EEG data by Principal Component Analysis reduces the quality of its subsequent Independent Component decomposition.\nIndependent Component Analysis (ICA) has proven to be an effective data driven method for analyzing EEG data, separating signals from temporally and functionally independent brain and non-brain source processes and thereby increasing their definition. Dimension reduction by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has often been recommended before ICA decomposition of EEG data, both to minimize the amount of required data and computation time. Here we compared ICA decompositions of fourteen 72-channel single subject EEG data sets obtained (i) after applying preliminary dimension reduction by PCA, (ii) after applying no such dimension reduction, or else (iii) applying PCA only. Reducing the data rank by PCA (even to remove only 1% of data variance) adversely affected both the numbers of dipolar independent components (ICs) and their stability under repeated decomposition. For example, decomposing a principal subspace retaining 95% of original data variance reduced the mean number of recovered 'dipolar' ICs from 30 to 10 per data set and reduced median IC stability from 90% to 76%. PCA rank reduction also decreased the numbers of near-equivalent ICs across subjects. For instance, decomposing a principal subspace retaining 95% of data variance reduced the number of subjects represented in an IC cluster accounting for frontal midline theta activity from 11 to 5. PCA rank reduction also increased uncertainty in the equivalent dipole positions and spectra of the IC brain effective sources. These results suggest that when applying ICA decomposition to EEG data, PCA rank reduction should best be avoided.",
   "Full body illusion is associated with widespread skin temperature reduction.\nA central feature of our consciousness is the experience of the self as a unified entity residing in a physical body, termed bodily self-consciousness. This phenomenon includes aspects such as the sense of owning a body (also known as body ownership) and has been suggested to arise from the integration of sensory signals from the body. Several studies have shown that temporally synchronous tactile stimulation of the real body and visual stimulation of a fake or virtual body can induce changes in bodily self-consciousness, typically resulting in a sense of illusory ownership over the fake body. The present study assessed the effect of anatomical congruency of visuo-tactile stimulation on bodily self-consciousness. A virtual body was presented and temporally synchronous visuo-tactile stroking was applied simultaneously to the participants' body and to the virtual body. We manipulated the anatomical locations of the visuo-tactile stroking (i.e., on the back, on the leg), resulting in congruent stroking (stroking was felt and seen on the back or the leg) or incongruent stroking (i.e., stroking was felt on the leg and seen on the back). We measured self-identification with the virtual body and self-location as well as skin temperature. Illusory self-identification with the avatar as well as changes in self-location were experienced in the congruent stroking conditions. Participants showed a decrease in skin temperature across several body locations during congruent stimulation. These data establish that the full-body illusion (FBI) alters bodily self-consciousness and instigates widespread physiological changes in the participant's body.",
   "Responses of vestibular nucleus neurons to inputs from the hindlimb are enhanced following a bilateral labyrinthectomy.\nVestibular nucleus neurons have been shown to respond to stimulation of afferents innervating the limbs. However, a limitation in the potential translation of these findings is that they were obtained from decerebrate or anesthetized animals. The goal of the present study was to determine whether stimulation of hindlimb nerves similarly affects vestibular nucleus neuronal activity in conscious cats, and whether the responsiveness of neurons to the stimuli is altered following a bilateral labyrinthectomy. In labyrinth-intact animals, the firing rate of 24/59 (41%) of the neurons in the caudal vestibular nucleus complex was affected by hindlimb nerve stimulation. Most responses were excitatory; the median response latency was 20 ms, but some units had response latencies as short as 10 ms. In the first week after a bilateral labyrinthectomy, the proportion of vestibular nucleus neurons that responded to hindlimb nerve stimulation increased slightly (to 24/55 or 44% of units). However, during the subsequent postlabyrinthectomy survival period, the proportion of vestibular nucleus neurons with hindlimb inputs increased significantly (to 30/49 or 61% of units). Stimuli to hindlimb nerves needed to elicit neuronal responses was consistently over three times the threshold for eliciting an afferent volley. These data show that inputs from hindlimb afferents smaller than those innervating muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs affect the processing of information in the vestibular nuclei, and that these inputs are enhanced following a bilateral labyrinthectomy. These findings have implications for the development of a limb neuroprosthetics device for the management of bilateral vestibular loss.",
   "The effect of frontoparietal paired associative stimulation on decision-making and working memory.\nPrevious single-site neurostimulation experiments have unsuccessfully attempted to shift decision-making away from habitual control, a fast, inflexible cognitive strategy, towards goal-directed control, a flexible, though computationally expensive strategy. We employed a dual-target neurostimulation approach in 30 healthy participants, using cortico-cortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS) to target two key nodes: lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS), to test whether decision-making can be artificially shifted from habitual toward goal-directed control. Participants received three active stimulations, delivered at least six days apart (each involving 100 paired pulses over the IPS and LPFC, varying the interstimulus interval): two interventional, time-relevant ccPAS (10\u00a0msec interval) and one control, non-time-relevant ccPAS (100\u00a0msec interval). Following stimulation, participants completed a sequential learning task, measuring goal-directed/habitual control, and a working memory task. IPS\u2192LPFC ccPAS (stimulating IPS, then LPFC with a 10\u00a0msec interval) shifted decision-making from habitual toward goal-directed control, compared to control ccPAS. There was no effect of LPFC\u2192IPS ccPAS, nor an effect of any PAS condition on working memory. Previous studies have shown ccPAS effects outside the motor domain targeting prefrontal regions on response inhibition, attentional bias, and alpha asymmetry. The present study measures the behavioural effects of parietal-prefrontal PAS, focusing on a highly complex decision-making task and working memory. If confirmed in larger studies, this would be the first instance of neurostimulation successfully shifting decision-making from habitual to goal-directed control, putatively via inducing long-term potentiation between the IPS and LPFC. However, we found no effect in the other direction (LPFC\u2192IPS ccPAS), and no effect on working memory overall. PAS is a relatively new neuromodulatory technique in the cognitive arsenal, and this study could help guide future approaches in healthy and disordered decision-making.",
   "Decoding of grasping tasks from intraneural recordings in trans-radial amputee.\nA major challenge in neuroprosthetics is the restoration of sensory-motor hand functions in upper-limb amputees. Neuroprostheses based on the direct re-connection of the peripheral nerves may be an interesting approach for re-establishing the natural and effective bidirectional control of hand prostheses. Recent results have shown that transverse intrafascicular multi-channel electrodes (TIMEs) can restore natural and sophisticated sensory feedback. However, the potential of using TIME-recorded motor intraneural signals to decode grasping tasks has not as yet been explored.",
   "Visual capture and the experience of having two bodies - Evidence from two different virtual reality techniques.\nIn neurology and psychiatry the detailed study of illusory own body perceptions has suggested close links between bodily processing and self-consciousness. One such illusory own body perception is heautoscopy where patients have the sensation of being reduplicated and to exist at two or even more locations. In previous experiments, using a video head-mounted display, self-location and self-identification were manipulated by applying conflicting visuo-tactile information. Yet the experienced singularity of the self was not affected, i.e., participants did not experience having multiple bodies or selves. In two experiments presented in this paper, we investigated self-location and self-identification while participants saw two virtual bodies (video-generated in study 1 and 3D computer generated in study 2) that were stroked either synchronously or asynchronously with their own body. In both experiments, we report that self-identification with two virtual bodies was stronger during synchronous stroking. Furthermore, in the video generated setup with synchronous stroking participants reported a greater feeling of having multiple bodies than in the control conditions. In study 1, but not in study 2, we report that self-location - measured by anterior posterior drift - was significantly shifted towards the two bodies in the synchronous condition only. Self-identification with two bodies, the sensation of having multiple bodies, and the changes in self-location show that the experienced singularity of the self can be studied experimentally. We discuss our data with respect to ownership for supernumerary hands and heautoscopy. We finally compare the effects of the video and 3D computer generated head-mounted display technology and discuss the possible benefits of using either technology to induce changes in illusory self-identification with a virtual body.",
   "A primer on brain-machine interfaces, concepts, and technology: a key element in the future of functional neurorestoration.\nConventionally, the practice of neurosurgery has been characterized by the removal of pathology, congenital or acquired. The emerging complement to the removal of pathology is surgery for the specific purpose of restoration of function. Advents in neuroscience, technology, and the understanding of neural circuitry are creating opportunities to intervene in disease processes in a reparative manner, thereby advancing toward the long-sought-after concept of neurorestoration. Approaching the issue of neurorestoration from a biomedical engineering perspective is the rapidly growing arena of implantable devices. Implantable devices are becoming more common in medicine and are making significant advancements to improve a patient's functional outcome. Devices such as deep brain stimulators, vagus nerve stimulators, and spinal cord stimulators are now becoming more commonplace in neurosurgery as we utilize our understanding of the nervous system to interpret neural activity and restore function. One of the most exciting prospects in neurosurgery is the technologically driven field of brain-machine interface, also known as brain-computer interface, or neuroprosthetics. The successful development of this technology will have far-reaching implications for patients suffering from a great number of diseases, including but not limited to spinal cord injury, paralysis, stroke, or loss of limb. This article provides an overview of the issues related to neurorestoration using implantable devices with a specific focus on brain-machine interface technology.",
   "Understanding ultrasound neuromodulation using a computationally efficient and interpretable model of intramembrane cavitation.\nLow-intensity focused ultrasound stimulation (LIFUS) emerges as an attracting technology for noninvasive modulation of neural circuits, yet the underlying action mechanisms remain unclear. The neuronal intramembrane cavitation excitation (NICE) model suggests that LIFUS excites neurons through a complex interplay between microsecond-scale mechanical oscillations of so-called sonophores in the plasma membrane and the development of a millisecond-scale electrical response. This model predicts cell-type-specific responses that correlate indirectly with experimental data, but it is computationally expensive and difficult to interpret, which hinders its potential validation. Here, we introduce a multi-scale optimized neuronal intramembrane cavitation (SONIC) model to achieve fast, accurate simulations and confer interpretability in terms of effective electrical response.",
   "Update on Peripheral Nerve Electrodes for Closed-Loop Neuroprosthetics.\nIn this paper various types of electrodes for stimulation and recording activity of peripheral nerves for the control of neuroprosthetic limbs are reviewed. First, an overview of interface devices for (feedback-) controlled movement of a prosthetic device is given, after which the focus is on peripheral nervous system (PNS) electrodes. Important electrode properties, i.e., longevity and spatial resolution, are defined based upon the usability for neuroprostheses. The cuff electrode, longitudinal intrafascicular electrodes (LIFE), transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode (TIME), Utah slanted electrode array (USEA), and the regenerative electrode are discussed and assessed on their longevity and spatial resolution. The cuff electrode seems to be a promising electrode for the control of neuroprostheses in the near future, because it shows the best longevity and good spatial resolution and it has been used on human subjects in multiple studies. The other electrodes may be promising in the future, but further research on their longevity and spatial resolution is needed. A more quantitatively uniform study protocol used for all electrodes would allow for a proper comparison of recording and stimulation performance. For example, the discussed electrodes could be compared in a large in vivo study, using one uniform comparison protocol.",
   "Vestibular modulation of peripersonal space boundaries.\nHuman-environment interactions are mediated through the body and occur within the peripersonal space (PPS), the space immediately adjacent to and surrounding the body. The PPS is taken to be a critical interface between the body and the environment, and indeed, body-part specific PPS remapping has been shown to depend on body-part utilization, such as upper limb movements in otherwise static observers. How vestibular signals induced by whole-body movement contribute to PPS representation is less well understood. In a series of experiments, we mapped the spatial extension of the PPS around the head while participants were submitted to passive whole-body rotations inducing vestibular stimulation. Forty-six participants, in three experiments, executed a tactile detection reaction time task while task-irrelevant auditory stimuli approached them. The maximal distance at which the auditory stimulus facilitated tactile reaction time was taken as a proxy for the boundary of peri-head space. The present results indicate two distinct vestibular effects. First, vestibular stimulation speeded tactile detection indicating a vestibular facilitation of somatosensory processing. Second, vestibular stimulation modulated audio-tactile interaction of peri-head space in a rotation direction-specific manner. Congruent but not incongruent audio-vestibular motion stimuli expanded the PPS boundary further away from the body as compared to no rotation. These results show that vestibular inputs dynamically update the multisensory delineation of PPS and far space, which may serve to maintain accurate tracking of objects close to the body and to update spatial self-representations.",
   "The functional role of beta-oscillations in the supplementary motor area during reaching and grasping after stroke: A question of structural damage to the corticospinal tract.\nHand motor function is often severely affected in stroke patients. Non-satisfying recovery limits reintegration into normal daily life. Understanding stroke-related network changes and identifying common principles that might underlie recovered motor function is a prerequisite for the development of interventional therapies to support recovery. Here, we combine the evaluation of functional activity (multichannel electroencephalography) and structural integrity (diffusion tensor imaging) in order to explain the degree of residual motor function in chronic stroke patients. By recording neural activity during a reaching and grasping task that mimics activities of daily living, the study focuses on deficit-related neural activation patterns. The study showed that the functional role of movement-related beta desynchronization in the supplementary motor area (SMA) for residual hand motor function in stroke patients depends on the microstructural integrity of the corticospinal tract (CST). In particular, in patients with damaged CST, stronger task-related activity in the SMA was associated with worse residual motor function. Neither CST damage nor functional brain activity alone sufficiently explained residual hand motor function. The findings suggest a central role of the SMA in the motor network during reaching and grasping in stroke patients, the degree of functional relevance of the SMA is depending on CST integrity.",
   "Visual Feedback Dominates the Sense of Agency for Brain-Machine Actions.\nRecent advances in neuroscience and engineering have led to the development of technologies that permit the control of external devices through real-time decoding of brain activity (brain-machine interfaces; BMI). Though the feeling of controlling bodily movements (sense of agency; SOA) has been well studied and a number of well-defined sensorimotor and cognitive mechanisms have been put forth, very little is known about the SOA for BMI-actions. Using an on-line BMI, and verifying that our subjects achieved a reasonable level of control, we sought to describe the SOA for BMI-mediated actions. Our results demonstrate that discrepancies between decoded neural activity and its resultant real-time sensory feedback are associated with a decrease in the SOA, similar to SOA mechanisms proposed for bodily actions. However, if the feedback discrepancy serves to correct a poorly controlled BMI-action, then the SOA can be high and can increase with increasing discrepancy, demonstrating the dominance of visual feedback on the SOA. Taken together, our results suggest that bodily and BMI-actions rely on common mechanisms of sensorimotor integration for agency judgments, but that visual feedback dominates the SOA in the absence of overt bodily movements or proprioceptive feedback, however erroneous the visual feedback may be.",
   "Acute human brain responses to intracortical microelectrode arrays: challenges and future prospects.\nThe emerging field of neuroprosthetics is focused on the development of new therapeutic interventions that will be able to restore some lost neural function by selective electrical stimulation or by harnessing activity recorded from populations of neurons. As more and more patients benefit from these approaches, the interest in neural interfaces has grown significantly and a new generation of penetrating microelectrode arrays are providing unprecedented access to the neurons of the central nervous system (CNS). These microelectrodes have active tip dimensions that are similar in size to neurons and because they penetrate the nervous system, they provide selective access to these cells (within a few microns). However, the very long-term viability of chronically implanted microelectrodes and the capability of recording the same spiking activity over long time periods still remain to be established and confirmed in human studies. Here we review the main responses to acute implantation of microelectrode arrays, and emphasize that it will become essential to control the neural tissue damage induced by these intracortical microelectrodes in order to achieve the high clinical potentials accompanying this technology.",
   "The Human Central Pattern Generator for Locomotion: Does It Exist and Contribute to Walking?\nThe ability of dedicated spinal circuits, referred to as central pattern generators (CPGs), to produce the basic rhythm and neural activation patterns underlying locomotion can be demonstrated under specific experimental conditions in reduced animal preparations. The existence of CPGs in humans is a matter of debate. Equally elusive is the contribution of CPGs to normal bipedal locomotion. To address these points, we focus on human studies that utilized spinal cord stimulation or pharmacological neuromodulation to generate rhythmic activity in individuals with spinal cord injury, and on neuromechanical modeling of human locomotion. In the absence of volitional motor control and step-specific sensory feedback, the human lumbar spinal cord can produce rhythmic muscle activation patterns that closely resemble CPG-induced neural activity of the isolated animal spinal cord. In this sense, CPGs in humans can be defined by the activity they produce. During normal locomotion, CPGs could contribute to the activation patterns during specific phases of the step cycle and simplify supraspinal control of step cycle frequency as a feedforward component to achieve a targeted speed. Determining how the human CPGs operate will be essential to advance the theory of neural control of locomotion and develop new locomotor neurorehabilitation paradigms.",
   "Towards a 'siliconeural computer': technological successes and challenges.\nElectronic signals govern the function of both nervous systems and computers, albeit in different ways. As such, hybridizing both systems to create an iono-electric brain-computer interface is a realistic goal; and one that promises exciting advances in both heterotic computing and neuroprosthetics capable of circumventing devastating neuropathology. 'Neural networks' were, in the 1980s, viewed naively as a potential panacea for all computational problems that did not fit well with conventional computing. The field bifurcated during the 1990s into a highly successful and much more realistic machine learning community and an equally pragmatic, biologically oriented 'neuromorphic computing' community. Algorithms found in nature that use the non-synchronous, spiking nature of neuronal signals have been found to be (i) implementable efficiently in silicon and (ii) computationally useful. As a result, interest has grown in techniques that could create mixed 'siliconeural' computers. Here, we discuss potential approaches and focus on one particular platform using parylene-patterned silicon dioxide.",
   "A thin-film multichannel electrode for muscle recording and stimulation in neuroprosthetics applications.\nWe propose, design and test a novel thin-film multichannel electrode that can be used for both recording from and stimulating a muscle in acute implants.",
   "Enhancing functional abilities and cognitive integration of the lower limb prosthesis.\nLower limb amputation (LLA) destroys the sensory communication between the brain and the external world during standing and walking. Current prostheses do not restore sensory feedback to amputees, who, relying on very limited haptic information from the stump-socket interaction, are forced to deal with serious issues: the risk of falls, decreased mobility, prosthesis being perceived as an external object (low embodiment), and increased cognitive burden. Poor mobility is one of the causes of eventual device abandonment. Restoring sensory feedback from the missing leg of above-knee (transfemoral) amputees and integrating the sensory feedback into the sensorimotor loop would markedly improve the life of patients. In this study, we developed a leg neuroprosthesis, which provided real-time tactile and emulated proprioceptive feedback to three transfemoral amputees through nerve stimulation. The feedback was exploited in active tasks, which proved that our approach promoted improved mobility, fall prevention, and agility. We also showed increased embodiment of the lower limb prosthesis (LLP), through phantom leg displacement perception and questionnaires, and ease of the cognitive effort during a dual-task paradigm, through electroencephalographic recordings. Our results demonstrate that induced sensory feedback can be integrated at supraspinal levels to restore functional abilities of the missing leg. This work paves the way for further investigations about how the brain interprets different artificial feedback strategies and for the development of fully implantable sensory-enhanced leg neuroprostheses, which could drastically ameliorate life quality in people with disability.",
   "Soft implantable microelectrodes for future medicine: prosthetics, neural signal recording and neuromodulation.\nImplantable devices have provided various potential diagnostic options and therapeutic methods in diverse medical fields. A variety of hard-material-based implantable electrodes have been developed. However, several limitations for their chronic implantation remain, including mechanical mismatches at the interface between the electrode and the soft tissue, and biocompatibility. Soft-material-based implantable devices are suitable candidates for complementing the limitations of hard electrodes. Advances in microtechnology and materials science have largely solved many challenges, such as optimization of shape, minimization of infection, enhancement of biocompatibility and integration with components for diverse functions. Significant strides have also been made in mechanical matching of electrodes to soft tissue. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advances in soft-material-based implantable electrodes for medical applications, categorized according to their implantation site and material composition. We then review specific applications in three categories: neuroprosthetics, neural signal recording, and neuromodulation. Finally, we describe various strategies for the future development and application of implantable, soft-material-based devices.",
   "Ambulatory Assessment of the Dynamic Margin of Stability Using an Inertial Sensor Network.\nLoss of stability is a precursor to falling and therefore represents a leading cause of injury, especially in fragile people. Thus, dynamic stability during activities of daily living (ADLs) needs to be considered to assess balance control and fall risk. The dynamic margin of stability (MOS) is often used as an indicator of how the body center of mass is located and moves relative to the base of support. In this work, we propose a magneto-inertial measurement unit (MIMU)-based method to assess the MOS of a gait. Six young healthy subjects were asked to walk on a treadmill at different velocities while wearing MIMUs on their lower limbs and pelvis. We then assessed the MOS by computing the lower body displacement with respect to the leading inverse kinematics approach. The results were compared with those obtained using a camera-based system in terms of root mean square deviation (RMSD) and correlation coefficient (\u03c1). We obtained a RMSD of \u22641.80 cm and \u03c1 \u2265 0.85 for each walking velocity. The findings revealed that our method is comparable to camera-based systems in terms of accuracy, suggesting that it may represent a strategy to assess stability during ADLs in unstructured environments.",
   "Closed-loop control of trunk posture improves locomotion through the regulation of leg proprioceptive feedback after spinal cord injury.\nAfter spinal cord injury (SCI), sensory feedback circuits critically contribute to leg motor execution. Compelled by the importance to engage these circuits during gait rehabilitation, assistive robotics and training protocols have primarily focused on guiding leg movements to reinforce sensory feedback. Despite the importance of trunk postural dynamics on gait and balance, trunk assistance has comparatively received little attention. Typically, trunk movements are either constrained within bodyweight support systems, or manually adjusted by therapists. Here, we show that real-time control of trunk posture re-established dynamic balance amongst bilateral proprioceptive feedback circuits, and thereby restored left-right symmetry, loading and stepping consistency in rats with severe SCI. We developed a robotic system that adjusts mediolateral trunk posture during locomotion. This system uncovered robust relationships between trunk orientation and the modulation of bilateral leg kinematics and muscle activity. Computer simulations suggested that these modulations emerged from corrections in the balance between flexor- and extensor-related proprioceptive feedback. We leveraged this knowledge to engineer control policies that regulate trunk orientation and postural sway in real-time. This dynamical postural interface immediately improved stepping quality in all rats regardless of broad differences in deficits. These results emphasize the importance of trunk regulation to optimize performance during rehabilitation.",
   "Anatomical and functional properties of the foot and leg representation in areas 3b, 1 and 2 of primary somatosensory cortex in humans: A 7T fMRI study.\nPrimary somatosensory cortex (S1) processes somatosensory information and is composed of multiple subregions. In particular, tactile information from the skin is encoded in three subregions, namely Brodmann areas (BAs) 3b, 1 and 2, with each area representing a complete map of the contralateral body. Although, much is known about the somatotopic organization of the hand in human S1, less research has been carried out regarding the somatotopic maps of the foot and leg in S1. Moreover, a latero-medial S1 organization along the superior part of the postcentral gyrus has been reported when moving from hip to toes, yet to date there is no study investigating leg/foot maps within the different subregions of S1. Using ultra-high field MRI (7T), we mapped six cortical representations of the lower limb (hip to toes) at the single subject level and performed this analysis separately for BAs 3b, 1 and 2. Analyzing the BOLD responses associated with tactile stimulations of the mapped foot and leg regions on each side, we quantified the extent and the strength of activation to determine somatotopic organization. In addition, we investigated whether each mapped representation also responded to the stimulation of other body parts (i.e. response selectivity) and conducted dissimilarity analysis relating these anatomical and functional properties of S1 to the physical structure of the lower limbs. Our data reveal somatotopy for the leg, but not for the foot in all investigated BAs, with large inter-subject variability. We found only minor differences between the properties of the three investigated BAs, suggesting that S1 maps for the lower limbs differ from those described for the hand. We also describe greater extent/strength of S1 activation for the big toe representation (compared to the other mapped representations) within all BAs, suggesting a possible homology between the first digit of upper and lower extremity in humans, and report different patterns of selectivity in the foot representations (i.e. lower selectivity) compared to the other leg representations (i.e. greater selectivity). These data provide a detailed description of human S1 subregions for the foot and leg, highlight the importance of high-resolution mapping studies and of single subject analysis, and indicate potential differences between the lower and the upper limb.",
   "Targeted neurotechnology restores walking in humans with spinal cord injury.\nSpinal cord injury leads to severe locomotor deficits or even complete leg paralysis. Here we introduce targeted spinal cord stimulation neurotechnologies that enabled voluntary control of walking in individuals who had sustained a spinal cord injury more than four years ago and presented with permanent motor deficits or complete paralysis despite extensive rehabilitation. Using an implanted pulse generator with real-time triggering capabilities, we delivered trains of spatially selective stimulation to the lumbosacral spinal cord with timing that coincided with the intended movement. Within one week, this spatiotemporal stimulation had re-established adaptive control of paralysed muscles during overground walking. Locomotor performance improved during rehabilitation. After a few months, participants regained voluntary control over previously paralysed muscles without stimulation and could walk or cycle in ecological settings during spatiotemporal stimulation. These results establish a technological framework for improving neurological recovery and supporting the activities of daily living after spinal cord injury.",
   "Coupling brain-machine interfaces with cortical stimulation for brain-state dependent stimulation: enhancing motor cortex excitability for neurorehabilitation.\nMotor recovery after stroke is an unsolved challenge despite intensive rehabilitation training programs. Brain stimulation techniques have been explored in addition to traditional rehabilitation training to increase the excitability of the stimulated motor cortex. This modulation of cortical excitability augments the response to afferent input during motor exercises, thereby enhancing skilled motor learning by long-term potentiation-like plasticity. Recent approaches examined brain stimulation applied concurrently with voluntary movements to induce more specific use-dependent neural plasticity during motor training for neurorehabilitation. Unfortunately, such approaches are not applicable for the many severely affected stroke patients lacking residual hand function. These patients require novel activity-dependent stimulation paradigms based on intrinsic brain activity. Here, we report on such brain state-dependent stimulation (BSDS) combined with haptic feedback provided by a robotic hand orthosis. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex and haptic feedback to the hand were controlled by sensorimotor desynchronization during motor-imagery and applied within a brain-machine interface (BMI) environment in one healthy subject and one patient with severe hand paresis in the chronic phase after stroke. BSDS significantly increased the excitability of the stimulated motor cortex in both healthy and post-stroke conditions, an effect not observed in non-BSDS protocols. This feasibility study suggests that closing the loop between intrinsic brain state, cortical stimulation and haptic feedback provides a novel neurorehabilitation strategy for stroke patients lacking residual hand function, a proposal that warrants further investigation in a larger cohort of stroke patients.",
   "Visual guidance in control of grasping.\nHumans and other primates possess a unique capacity to grasp and manipulate objects skillfully, a facility pervasive in everyday life that has undoubtedly contributed to the success of our species. When we reach and grasp an object, various cortical areas in the parietal and frontal lobes work together effortlessly to analyze object shape and position, transform this visual information into useful motor commands, and implement these motor representations to preshape the hand before contact with the object is made. In recent years, a growing number of studies have investigated the neural circuits underlying object grasping in both the visual and motor systems of the macaque monkey. The accumulated knowledge not only helps researchers understand how object grasping is implemented in the primate brain but may also contribute to the development of novel neural interfaces and neuroprosthetics.",
   "Neural Sources and Underlying Mechanisms of Neural Responses to Heartbeats, and their Role in Bodily Self-consciousness: An Intracranial EEG Study.\nRecent research has shown that heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs), brain activity in response to heartbeats, are a useful neural measure for investigating the functional role of brain-body interactions in cognitive processes including self-consciousness. In 2 experiments, using intracranial electroencephalography (EEG), we investigated (1) the neural sources of HEPs, (2) the underlying mechanisms for HEP generation, and (3) the functional role of HEPs in bodily self-consciousness. In Experiment-1, we found that shortly after the heartbeat onset, phase distributions across single trials were significantly concentrated in 10% of the recording sites, mainly in the insula and the operculum, but also in other regions including the amygdala and fronto-temporal cortex. Such phase concentration was not accompanied by increased spectral power, and did not correlate with spectral power changes, suggesting that a phase resetting, rather than an additive \"evoked potential\" mechanism, underlies HEP generation. In Experiment-2, we further aimed to anatomically refine previous scalp EEG data that linked HEPs with bodily self-consciousness. We found that HEP modulations in the insula reflected an experimentally induced altered sense of self-identification. Collectively, these results provide novel and solid electrophysiological evidence on the neural sources and underlying mechanisms of HEPs, and their functional role in self-consciousness.",
   "Development, manufacturing and application of double-sided flexible implantable microelectrodes.\nMany neuroprosthetic applications require the use of very small, flexible multi-channel microelectrodes (e.g. polyimide-based film-like electrodes) to fit anatomical constraints. By arranging the electrode contacts on both sides of the polyimide film, selectivity can be further increased without increasing size. In this work, two approaches to create such double-sided electrodes are described and compared: sandwich electrodes prepared by precisely gluing two single-sided structures together, and monolithic electrodes created using a new double-sided photolithography process. Both methods were successfully applied to manufacture double-sided electrodes for stimulation of the vestibular system. In a case study, the electrodes were implanted in the semicircular canals of three guinea pigs and proven to provide electrical stimulation of the vestibular nerve. For both the monolithic electrodes and the sandwich electrodes, long-term stability and functionality was observed over a period of more than 12 months. Comparing the two types of electrodes with respect to the manufacturing process, it can be concluded that monolithic electrodes are the preferred solution for very thin electrodes (<20 \u03bcm), while sandwich electrode technology is especially suitable for thicker electrodes (40-50 \u03bcm).",
   "Design and realization of a wireless sensor gateway for health monitoring.\nThis paper describes the design and realization of a wireless sensor gateway (WSG) within a wireless sensor network (WSN) for health monitoring. The WSN allows recording and wireless transmission of biosignals, namely the electrocardiogram, pulse wave and body weight, which are important parameters for cardiovascular monitoring. These can be displayed, analysed, and saved on the WSG through a user interface based on a touch screen. The proposed WSG has the distinctive feature of using two different radio transceivers, exploiting the advantages of each device. Currently, most personal computers and handhelds have standardized Bluetooth interfaces (IEEE 802.15.1) but not ZigBee interfaces (IEEE 802.15.4). Hence, the proposed gateway is designed to receive data from wireless sensors through its ZigBee interface and to forward them to a personal computer via its Bluetooth interface. This feature, combined with simple touch screen menu navigation will reach increased patient compliance and consequently increased benefit for patient in terms of healthcare and safety.",
   "Multifunctional conducting fibres with electrically controlled release of ciprofloxacin.\nWe hereby present a new method of producing coaxial conducting polymer fibres loaded with an antibiotic drug that can then be subsequently released (or sustained) in response to electrical stimulation. The method involves wet-spinning of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) fibre, which served as the inner core to the electropolymerised outer shell layer of polypyrrole (Ppy). Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (Cipro) was selected as the model drug and as the dopant in the Ppy synthesis. The release of Cipro in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) from the fibres was controlled by switching the redox state of Ppy.Cipro layer. Released Cipro under passive and stimulated conditions were tested against Gram positive (Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria. Significant inhibition of bacterial growth was observed against both strains tested. These results confirm that Cipro retains antibacterial properties during fibre fabrication and electrochemically controlled release. In vitro cytotoxicity testing utilising the neural B35 cell line confirmed the cytocompatibility of the drug loaded conducting fibres. Electrical conductivity, cytocompatibility and tuning release profile from this flexible fibre can lead to promising bionic applications such as neuroprosthetics and localised drug delivery.",
   "Can Daytime Napping Assist the Process of Skills Acquisition After Stroke?\nAcquisition and reacquisition of skills is a main pillar of functional recovery after stroke. Nighttime sleep has a positive influence on motor learning in healthy individuals, whereas the effect of daytime sleep on neuro-rehabilitative training and relearning of the trained skills is often neglected. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between daytime sleep (napping) and the ability to learn a new visuomotor task in chronic stroke patients. The main hypothesis was that sleep enhances motor memory consolidation after training resulting in better motor performance after a period of daytime sleep. Thirty stroke survivors completed the study. They were randomized to one of three different conditions (i) wakeful resting, (ii) short nap (10-20 min), or (iii) long nap (50-80 min). All individuals trained the task with the contralesional, stroke-impaired hand, behavioral evaluation was performed after the break time (wake, nap), and 24 h later. Patients demonstrated a significant task-related behavioral improvement throughout the training. In contrast to the main hypothesis, there was no evidence for sleep-dependent motor consolidation early after the initial, diurnal break, or after an additional full night of sleep. In a secondary analysis, the performance changes of stroke survivors were compared with those of a group of healthy older adults who performed the identical task within the same experimental setup with their non-dominant hand. Performance levels were comparable between both cohorts at all time points. Stroke-related difficulties in motor control did not impact on the degree of performance improvement through training and daytime sleep did not impact on the behavioral gains in the two groups. In summary, the current study indicates that one-time daytime sleep after motor training does not influence behavioral gains.",
   "Brain-actuated functional electrical stimulation elicits lasting arm motor recovery after stroke.\nBrain-computer interfaces (BCI) are used in stroke rehabilitation to translate brain signals into intended movements of the paralyzed limb. However, the efficacy and mechanisms of BCI-based therapies remain unclear. Here we show that BCI coupled to functional electrical stimulation (FES) elicits significant, clinically relevant, and lasting motor recovery in chronic stroke survivors more effectively than sham FES. Such recovery is associated to quantitative signatures of functional neuroplasticity. BCI patients exhibit a significant functional recovery after the intervention, which remains 6-12 months after the end of therapy. Electroencephalography analysis pinpoints significant differences in favor of the BCI group, mainly consisting in an increase in functional connectivity between motor areas in the affected hemisphere. This increase is significantly correlated with functional improvement. Results illustrate how a BCI-FES therapy can drive significant functional recovery and purposeful plasticity thanks to contingent activation of body natural efferent and afferent pathways.",
   "Clinical neuroprosthetics: Today and tomorrow.\nImplantable neurostimulation devices provide a direct therapeutic link to the nervous system and can be considered brain-computer interfaces (BCI). Under this definition, BCI are not simply science fiction, they are part of existing neurosurgical practice. Clinical BCI are standard of care for historically difficult to treat neurological disorders. These systems target the central and peripheral nervous system and include Vagus Nerve Stimulation, Responsive Neurostimulation, and Deep Brain Stimulation. Recent advances in clinical BCI have focused on creating \"closed-loop\" systems. These systems rely on biomarker feedback and promise individualized therapy with optimal stimulation delivery and minimal side effects. Success of clinical BCI has paralleled research efforts to create BCI that restore upper extremity motor and sensory function to patients. Efforts to develop closed loop motor/sensory BCI is linked to the successes of today's clinical BCI.",
   "Artificial balance: restoration of the vestibulo-ocular reflex in humans with a prototype vestibular neuroprosthesis.\nThe vestibular system plays a crucial role in the multisensory control of balance. When vestibular function is lost, essential tasks such as postural control, gaze stabilization, and spatial orientation are limited and the quality of life of patients is significantly impaired. Currently, there is no effective treatment for bilateral vestibular deficits. Research efforts both in animals and humans during the last decade set a solid background to the concept of using electrical stimulation to restore vestibular function. Still, the potential clinical benefit of a vestibular neuroprosthesis has to be demonstrated to pave the way for a translation into clinical trials. An important parameter for the assessment of vestibular function is the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), the primary mechanism responsible for maintaining the perception of a stable visual environment while moving. Here we show that the VOR can be artificially restored in humans using motion-controlled, amplitude modulated electrical stimulation of the ampullary branches of the vestibular nerve. Three patients received a vestibular neuroprosthesis prototype, consisting of a modified cochlear implant providing vestibular electrodes. Significantly higher VOR responses were observed when the prototype was turned ON. Furthermore, VOR responses increased significantly as the intensity of the stimulation increased, reaching on average 79% of those measured in healthy volunteers in the same experimental conditions. These results constitute a fundamental milestone and allow us to envision for the first time clinically useful rehabilitation of patients with bilateral vestibular loss.",
   "An invisible touch: Body-related multisensory conflicts modulate visual consciousness.\nThe majority of scientific studies on consciousness have focused on vision, exploring the cognitive and neural mechanisms of conscious access to visual stimuli. In parallel, studies on bodily consciousness have revealed that bodily (i.e. tactile, proprioceptive, visceral, vestibular) signals are the basis for the sense of self. However, the role of bodily signals in the formation of visual consciousness is not well understood. Here we investigated how body-related visuo-tactile stimulation modulates conscious access to visual stimuli. We used a robotic platform to apply controlled tactile stimulation to the participants' back while they viewed a dot moving either in synchrony or asynchrony with the touch on their back. Critically, the dot was rendered invisible through continuous flash suppression. Manipulating the visual context by presenting the dot moving on either a body form, or a non-bodily object we show that: (i) conflict induced by synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation in a body context is associated with a delayed conscious access compared to asynchronous visuo-tactile stimulation, (ii) this effect occurs only in the context of a visual body form, and (iii) is not due to detection or response biases. The results indicate that body-related visuo-tactile conflicts impact visual consciousness by facilitating access of non-conflicting visual information to awareness, and that these are sensitive to the visual context in which they are presented, highlighting the interplay between bodily signals and visual experience.",
   "Brain-controlled modulation of spinal circuits improves recovery from spinal cord injury.\nThe delivery of brain-controlled neuromodulation therapies during motor rehabilitation may augment recovery from neurological disorders. To test this hypothesis, we conceived a brain-controlled neuromodulation therapy that combines the technical and practical features necessary to be deployed daily during gait rehabilitation. Rats received a severe spinal cord contusion that led to leg paralysis. We engineered a proportional brain-spine interface whereby cortical ensemble activity constantly determines the amplitude of spinal cord stimulation protocols promoting leg flexion during swing. After minimal calibration time and without prior training, this neural bypass enables paralyzed rats to walk overground and adjust foot clearance in order to climb a staircase. Compared to continuous spinal cord stimulation, brain-controlled stimulation accelerates and enhances the long-term recovery of locomotion. These results demonstrate the relevance of brain-controlled neuromodulation therapies to augment recovery from motor disorders, establishing important proofs-of-concept that warrant clinical studies.",
   "Neural Network Model of Vestibular Nuclei Reaction to Onset of Vestibular Prosthetic Stimulation.\nThe vestibular system incorporates multiple sensory pathways to provide crucial information about head and body motion. Damage to the semicircular canals, the peripheral vestibular organs that sense rotational velocities of the head, can severely degrade the ability to perform activities of daily life. Vestibular prosthetics address this problem by using stimulating electrodes that can trigger primary vestibular afferents to modulate their firing rates, thus encoding head movement. These prostheses have been demonstrated chronically in multiple animal models and acutely tested in short-duration trials within the clinic in humans. However, mainly, due to limited opportunities to fully characterize stimulation parameters, there is a lack of understanding of \"optimal\" stimulation configurations for humans. Here, we model possible adaptive plasticity in the vestibular pathway. Specifically, this model highlights the influence of adaptation of synaptic strengths and offsets in the vestibular nuclei to compensate for the initial activation of the prosthetic. By changing the synaptic strengths, the model is able to replicate the clinical observation that erroneous eye movements are attenuated within 30\u2009minutes without any change to the prosthetic stimulation rate. Although our model was only built to match this time point, we further examined how it affected subsequent pulse rate modulation (PRM) and pulse amplitude modulation (PAM). PAM was more effective than PRM for nearly all stimulation configurations during these acute tests. Two non-intuitive relationships highlighted by our model explain this performance discrepancy. Specifically, the attenuation of synaptic strengths for afferents stimulated during baseline adaptation and the discontinuity between baseline and residual firing rates both disproportionally boost PAM. Comodulation of pulse rate and amplitude has been experimentally shown to induce both excitatory and inhibitory eye movements even at high baseline stimulation rates. We also modeled comodulation and found synergistic combinations of stimulation parameters to achieve equivalent output to only amplitude modulation. This may be an important strategy to reduce current spread and misalignment. The model outputs reflected observed trends in clinical testing and aspects of existing vestibular prosthetic literature. Importantly, the model provided insight to efficiently explore the stimulation parameter space, which was helpful, given limited available patient time.",
   "Restoring Behavior via Inverse Neurocontroller in a Lesioned Cortical Spiking Model Driving a Virtual Arm.\nNeural stimulation can be used as a tool to elicit natural sensations or behaviors by modulating neural activity. This can be potentially used to mitigate the damage of brain lesions or neural disorders. However, in order to obtain the optimal stimulation sequences, it is necessary to develop neural control methods, for example by constructing an inverse model of the target system. For real brains, this can be very challenging, and often unfeasible, as it requires repeatedly stimulating the neural system to obtain enough probing data, and depends on an unwarranted assumption of stationarity. By contrast, detailed brain simulations may provide an alternative testbed for understanding the interactions between ongoing neural activity and external stimulation. Unlike real brains, the artificial system can be probed extensively and precisely, and detailed output information is readily available. Here we employed a spiking network model of sensorimotor cortex trained to drive a realistic virtual musculoskeletal arm to reach a target. The network was then perturbed, in order to simulate a lesion, by either silencing neurons or removing synaptic connections. All lesions led to significant behvaioral impairments during the reaching task. The remaining cells were then systematically probed with a set of single and multiple-cell stimulations, and results were used to build an inverse model of the neural system. The inverse model was constructed using a kernel adaptive filtering method, and was used to predict the neural stimulation pattern required to recover the pre-lesion neural activity. Applying the derived neurostimulation to the lesioned network improved the reaching behavior performance. This work proposes a novel neurocontrol method, and provides theoretical groundwork on the use biomimetic brain models to develop and evaluate neurocontrollers that restore the function of damaged brain regions and the corresponding motor behaviors.",
   "Increasing upper limb training intensity in chronic stroke using embodied virtual reality: a pilot study.\nTechnology-mediated neurorehabilitation is suggested to enhance training intensity and therefore functional gains. Here, we used a novel virtual reality (VR) system for task-specific upper extremity training after stroke. The system offers interactive exercises integrating motor priming techniques and embodied visuomotor feedback. In this pilot study, we examined (i) rehabilitation dose and training intensity, (ii) functional improvements, and (iii) safety and tolerance when exposed to intensive VR rehabilitation.",
   "Decoding Finger Flexion from Band-Specific ECoG Signals in Humans.\nThis article presents the method that won the brain-computer interface (BCI) competition IV addressed to the prediction of the finger flexion from electrocorticogram (ECoG) signals. ECoG-based BCIs have recently drawn the attention from the community. Indeed, ECoG can provide higher spatial resolution and better signal quality than classical EEG recordings. It is also more suitable for long-term use. These characteristics allow to decode precise brain activities and to realize efficient ECoG-based neuroprostheses. Signal processing is a very important task in BCIs research for translating brain signals into commands. Here, we present a linear regression method based on the amplitude modulation of band-specific ECoG including a short-term memory for individual finger flexion prediction. The effectiveness of the method was proven by achieving the highest value of correlation coefficient between the predicted and recorded finger flexion values on data set 4 during the BCI competition IV.",
   "Gene Editing Preserves Visual Functions in a Mouse Model of Retinal Degeneration.\nInherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) are a large and heterogeneous group of degenerative diseases caused by mutations in various genes. Given the favorable anatomical and immunological characteristics of the eye, gene therapy holds great potential for their treatment. Our goal is to validate the preservation of visual functions by viral-free homology directed repair (HDR) in an autosomal recessive loss of function mutation. We used a tailored gene editing system based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) to prevent retinal photoreceptor death in the retinal degeneration 10 (Rd10) mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa. We tested the gene editing tool in vitro and then used in vivo subretinal electroporation to deliver it to one of the retinas of mouse pups at different stages of photoreceptor differentiation. Three months after gene editing, the treated eye exhibited a higher visual acuity compared to the untreated eye. Moreover, we observed preservation of light-evoked responses both in explanted retinas and in the visual cortex of treated animals. Our study validates a CRISPR/Cas9-based therapy as a valuable new approach for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa caused by autosomal recessive loss-of-function point mutations.",
   "Numerical Priming Between Touch and Vision Depends on Tactile Discrimination.\nAlthough the interaction between vision and touch is of crucial importance for perceptual and bodily self-consciousness, only little is known regarding the link between conscious access and tactile processing. Here, we tested whether the numerical encoding of tactile stimuli depends on conscious discrimination. On each trial, participants received between zero and three taps at low, medium, or high intensity and had to enumerate the number of visual items subsequently presented as a visual target. We measured tactovisual numerical priming, that is, the modulation of reaction times according to the numerical distance between the visual target and tactile prime values. While numerical priming and repetition priming were respectively elicited by high and medium intensity stimuli, no effect was found for low intensity stimuli that were not discriminable. This suggests that numerical priming between touch and vision depends on tactile discrimination. We discuss our results considering recent advances in unconscious visual numerical priming.",
   "A bioinspired analogous nerve towards artificial intelligence.\nA bionic artificial device commonly integrates various distributed functional units to mimic the functions of biological sensory neural system, bringing intricate interconnections, complicated structure, and interference in signal transmission. Here we show an all-in-one bionic artificial nerve based on a separate electrical double-layers structure that integrates the functions of perception, recognition, and transmission. The bionic artificial nerve features flexibility, rapid response (<21\u2009ms), high robustness, excellent durability (>10,000 tests), personalized cutability, and no energy consumption when no mechanical stimulation is being\u00a0applied. The response signals are highly regionally differentiated for the mechanical stimulations, which enables the bionic artificial nerve to mimic the spatiotemporally dynamic logic of a biological neural network. Multifunctional touch interactions demonstrate the enormous potential of the bionic artificial nerve for human-machine hybrid perceptual enhancement. By incorporating the spatiotemporal resolution function and algorithmic analysis, we hope\u00a0that bionic artificial nerves will promote further development of sophisticated\u00a0neuroprosthetics and intelligent robotics.",
   "Long-term stability of intracortical recordings using perforated and arrayed Parylene sheath electrodes.\nAcquisition of reliable and robust neural recordings with intracortical neural probes is a persistent challenge in the field of neuroprosthetics.

   "Inverse estimation of muscle activations from joint torque via local multiple regression.\nThe signal measured with an electromyogram (EMG) is the summation of all action potentials of motor units active at a certain time. According to previous literature, one can establish the relationship between torque and EMG/activations in a forward way, i.e., employing EMG of multiple channels to estimate the joint torque. Once the relationship is established, the torque can be predicted with EMG recordings. However, in some applications of neuroprosthetics where we need to make muscle control, it is required to inversely have an insight regarding the muscle activations under a specific motion scenario from the corresponding torque. Motivated by this point, this paper investigates inverse estimation of muscle activations in random contractions at the ankle joint. Local multiple regression is exploited for finding the relationship between muscle activations and torque. Such technique is able to rebuild the relationship between muscle activations and joint torque inversely based on experimental data obtained from five able-bodied subjects, and the resultant optimal weight matrix can indicate each muscle's contribution in the production of the torque. Further cross validation on prediction of muscle activations with joint torque with optimal weights shows that such approach may possess promising performance.",
   "Data-driven body-machine interface for the accurate control of drones.\nThe accurate teleoperation of robotic devices requires simple, yet intuitive and reliable control interfaces. However, current human-machine interfaces (HMIs) often fail to fulfill these characteristics, leading to systems requiring an intensive practice to reach a sufficient operation expertise. Here, we present a systematic methodology to identify the spontaneous gesture-based interaction strategies of naive individuals with a distant device, and to exploit this information to develop a data-driven body-machine interface (BoMI) to efficiently control this device. We applied this approach to the specific case of drone steering and derived a simple control method relying on upper-body motion. The identified BoMI allowed participants with no prior experience to rapidly master the control of both simulated and real drones, outperforming joystick users, and comparing with the control ability reached by participants using the bird-like flight simulator Birdly.",
   "Exploiting Task Constraints for Self-Calibrated Brain-Machine Interface Control Using Error-Related Potentials.\nThis paper presents a new approach for self-calibration BCI for reaching tasks using error-related potentials. The proposed method exploits task constraints to simultaneously calibrate the decoder and control the device, by using a robust likelihood function and an ad-hoc planner to cope with the large uncertainty resulting from the unknown task and decoder. The method has been evaluated in closed-loop online experiments with 8 users using a previously proposed BCI protocol for reaching tasks over a grid. The results show that it is possible to have a usable BCI control from the beginning of the experiment without any prior calibration. Furthermore, comparisons with simulations and previous results obtained using standard calibration hint that both the quality of recorded signals and the performance of the system were comparable to those obtained with a standard calibration approach.",
   "Moving sounds within the peripersonal space modulate the motor system.\nInteractions between ourselves and the external world are mediated by a multisensory representation of the space surrounding the body, i.e. the peripersonal space (PPS). In particular, a special interplay is observed among tactile stimuli delivered on a body part, e.g. the hand, and visual or auditory external inputs presented close, but not far, from the same body part, e.g. within hand PPS. This coding of multisensory stimuli as a function of their distance from the hand has a role in upper limb actions. However, it remains unclear whether PPS representation affects the motor system only when stimuli occur specifically at the hand location or when they move within a continuous portion of space where the hand can potentially act. Here, in order to study these two alternatively hypotheses, we assessed the critical distance at which moving sounds have a direct effect on hand corticospinal excitability by using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). Specifically, TMS single pulses were delivered when a sound source was perceived at six different positions in space: from very close to subjects' hand (15 cm) to far away (90 cm). Moreover, sound direction was manipulated to test if stimuli approaching and receding from the hand might have the same relevance for the motor system. MEPs amplitude was enhanced when sounds were delivered within a limited distance from the hand (around 60 cm) as compared to when the sounds were beyond this space. This effect captures the spatial boundaries within which PPS representation modulates hand cortico-motor excitability. This spatially-dependent modulation of corticospinal activity was not further affected by the sound direction. Such findings support a strict link between the multisensory representation of the space around the body and the motor representation of potential approaching or defensive acts within that space.",
   "3D hybrid electrode structure as implantable interface for a vestibular neural prosthesis in humans.\nImplantable interfaces are essential components of vestibular neural prostheses. They interface the biological system with electrical stimulation that is used to restore transfer of vestibular information. Regarding the anatomical situation special 3D structures are required. In this paper, the design and the manufacturing process of a novel 3D hybrid microelectrode structure as interface to the human vestibular system are described. Photolithography techniques, assembling technology and rapid prototyping are used for manufacturing.",
   "[Surgical neuromodulation: new frontiers in neurosurgery].\nSurgical neuromodulation refers to all those techniques that use implantable devices that discharge electricity or chemical substances that modify nerve signal transmission in order to achieve inhibition, excitation or modulation of the activity of neuronal groups and networks, and to achieve a therapeutic effect.

   "Towards real-time communication between in vivo neurophysiological data sources and simulator-based brain biomimetic models.\nDevelopment of more sophisticated implantable brain-machine interface (BMI) will require both interpretation of the neurophysiological data being measured and subsequent determination of signals to be delivered back to the brain. Computational models are the heart of the machine of BMI and therefore an essential tool in both of these processes. One approach is to utilize brain biomimetic models (BMMs) to develop and instantiate these algorithms. These then must be connected as hybrid systems in order to interface the BMM with in vivo data acquisition devices and prosthetic devices. The combined system then provides a test bed for neuroprosthetic rehabilitative solutions and medical devices for the repair and enhancement of damaged brain. We propose here a computer network-based design for this purpose, detailing its internal modules and data flows. We describe a prototype implementation of the design, enabling interaction between the Plexon Multichannel Acquisition Processor (MAP) server, a commercial tool to collect signals from microelectrodes implanted in a live subject and a BMM, a NEURON-based model of sensorimotor cortex capable of controlling a virtual arm. The prototype implementation supports an online mode for real-time simulations, as well as an offline mode for data analysis and simulations without real-time constraints, and provides binning operations to discretize continuous input to the BMM and filtering operations for dealing with noise. Evaluation demonstrated that the implementation successfully delivered monkey spiking activity to the BMM through LAN environments, respecting real-time constraints.",
   "Sensory feedback restoration in leg amputees improves walking speed, metabolic cost and phantom pain.\nConventional leg prostheses do not convey sensory information about motion or interaction with the ground to above-knee amputees, thereby reducing confidence and walking speed in the users that is associated with high mental and physical fatigue1-4. The lack of physiological feedback from the remaining extremity to the brain also contributes to the generation of phantom limb pain from the missing leg5,6. To determine whether neural sensory feedback restoration addresses these issues, we conducted a study with two transfemoral amputees, implanted with four intraneural stimulation electrodes7 in the remaining tibial nerve (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03350061). Participants were evaluated while using a neuroprosthetic device consisting of a prosthetic leg equipped with foot and knee sensors. These sensors drive neural stimulation, which elicits sensations of knee motion and the sole of the foot touching the ground. We found that walking speed and self-reported confidence increased while mental and physical fatigue decreased for both participants during neural sensory feedback compared to the no stimulation trials. Furthermore, participants exhibited reduced phantom limb pain with neural sensory feedback. The results from these proof-of-concept cases provide the rationale for larger population studies investigating the clinical utility of neuroprostheses that restore sensory feedback.",
   "Detection of optogenetic stimulation in somatosensory cortex by non-human primates--towards artificial tactile sensation.\nNeuroprosthesis research aims to enable communication between the brain and external assistive devices while restoring lost functionality such as occurs from stroke, spinal cord injury or neurodegenerative diseases. In future closed-loop sensorimotor prostheses, one approach is to use neuromodulation as direct stimulus to the brain to compensate for a lost sensory function and help the brain to integrate relevant information for commanding external devices via, e.g. movement intention. Current neuromodulation techniques rely mainly of electrical stimulation. Here we focus specifically on the question of eliciting a biomimetically relevant sense of touch by direct stimulus of the somatosensory cortex by introducing optogenetic techniques as an alternative to electrical stimulation. We demonstrate that light activated opsins can be introduced to target neurons in the somatosensory cortex of non-human primates and be optically activated to create a reliably detected sensation which the animal learns to interpret as a tactile sensation localized within the hand. The accomplishment highlighted here shows how optical stimulation of a relatively small group of mostly excitatory somatosensory neurons in the nonhuman primate brain is sufficient for eliciting a useful sensation from data acquired by simultaneous electrophysiology and from behavioral metrics. In this first report to date on optically neuromodulated behavior in the somatosensory cortex of nonhuman primates we do not yet dissect the details of the sensation the animals exerience or contrast it to those evoked by electrical stimulation, issues of considerable future interest.",
   "Transferring brain-computer interfaces beyond the laboratory: successful application control for motor-disabled users.\nBrain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are no longer only used by healthy participants under controlled conditions in laboratory environments, but also by patients and end-users, controlling applications in their homes or clinics, without the BCI experts around. But are the technology and the field mature enough for this? Especially the successful operation of applications - like text entry systems or assistive mobility devices such as tele-presence robots - requires a good level of BCI control. How much training is needed to achieve such a level? Is it possible to train na\u00efve end-users in 10 days to successfully control such applications?",
   "Human EEG reveals distinct neural correlates of power and precision grasping types.\nHand grasping is a sophisticated motor task that has received much attention by the neuroscientific community, which demonstrated how grasping activates a network involving parietal, pre-motor and motor cortices using fMRI, ECoG, LFPs and spiking activity. Yet, there is a need for a more precise spatio-temporal analysis as it is still unclear how these brain activations over large cortical areas evolve at the sub-second level. In this study, we recorded ten human participants (1 female) performing visually-guided, self-paced reaching and grasping with precision or power grips. Following the results, we demonstrate the existence of neural correlates of grasping from broadband EEG in self-paced conditions and show how neural correlates of precision and power grasps differentially evolve as grasps unfold. 100\u202fms before the grasp is secured, bilateral parietal regions showed increasingly differential patterns. Afterwards, sustained differences between both grasps occurred over the bilateral motor and parietal regions, and medial pre-frontal cortex. Furthermore, these differences were sufficiently discriminable to allow single-trial decoding with 70% decoding performance. Functional connectivity revealed differences at the network level between grasps in fronto-parietal networks, in terms of upper-alpha cortical oscillatory power with a strong involvement of ipsilateral hemisphere. Our results supported the existence of fronto-parietal recurrent feedback loops, with stronger interactions for precision grips due to the finer motor control required for this grasping type.",

   "Interaction of glia with a compliant, microstructured silicone surface.\nSoft bioengineered surfaces offer a route towards modulating the tissue responses to chronically implanted devices and may enhance their functionality. In this communication we fabricate microtopographically rich and mechanically compliant silicone surfaces for use in soft neural interfaces. We observe the interaction of primary rat microglia and astroglia with arrays of tall and short (4.7 and 0.5\u03bcm) vertically oriented polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micropillars and a flat PDMS surface in vitro. With the pillar size and spacing that we use (1.3\u03bcm diameter and 1.6\u03bcm edge to edge), glia are found to engulf and bend tall pillars. The cytoskeleton of cells adhering to the pillar arrays lacks actin stress fibers; instead we observe actin ring formations around individual pillars. Tall, but not short pillar arrays are inhibitory to migration and spreading for both microglia and astrocytes. When compared to a flat PDMS surface and short pillar arrays, tall micropillar arrays cause nearly a 2-fold decrease in proliferation rates for both cell types. The antimitotic properties of tall pillar arrays may be useful for reducing the density of the glial capsule around brain-implanted devices.",
   "Post-Stroke Longitudinal Alterations of Inter-Hemispheric Correlation and Hemispheric Dominance in Mouse Pre-Motor Cortex.\nLimited restoration of function is known to occur spontaneously after an ischemic injury to the primary motor cortex. Evidence suggests that Pre-Motor Areas (PMAs) may \"take over\" control of the disrupted functions. However, little is known about functional reorganizations in PMAs. Forelimb movements in mice can be driven by two cortical regions, Caudal and Rostral Forelimb Areas (CFA and RFA), generally accepted as primary motor and pre-motor cortex, respectively. Here, we examined longitudinal changes in functional coupling between the two RFAs following unilateral photothrombotic stroke in CFA (mm from Bregma: +0.5 anterior, +1.25 lateral).",
   "The cognitive and neural time course of empathy and sympathy: an electrical neuroimaging study on self-other interaction.\nAlthough extensively investigated in socio-cognitive neuroscience, empathy is difficult to study. The first difficulty originates in its multifaceted nature. According to the multidimensional model, empathy combines emotional, automatic (simulation), cognitive (mentalizing) and regulatory (executive functions) processes. Substantial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data demonstrated that co-activations in the mirror neuron system (MNS) and mentalizing network (MENT) sustain this co-recruitment of so-called first- and second-person-like processes. Because of the poor temporal resolution of fMRI techniques, we currently lack evidence about the precise timing of the MNS-MENT combination. An important challenge is, thus, to disentangle how MNS and MENT dynamically work together along time in empathy. Moreover, the role of the executive functions in the MNS-MENT combination time course is still unknown. Second, empathy - feeling into - is closely related to sympathy - feeling with - and both phenomena are often conflated in experimental studies on intersubjectivity. In this electrical neuroimaging (EEG) pilot-study, we tested whether the egocentered vs. heterocentered visuo-spatial mechanisms respectively associated with sympathy and empathy differentially modulate the dynamic combination of the MNS-MENT activations in their respective neural time course. For that, we employed our newly developed behavioral paradigm assessing the visuo-spatial - but not emotional - features of empathy and sympathy. Using a data-driven approach, we report that empathy and sympathy are underlied by sequential activations in the MNS from the insula to the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) between 63ms and 424ms. However, at 333-424ms, empathy triggered greater co-activations in the right IFG and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) (executive functions). Linking together our present and prior (Thirioux et al., 2010) findings from the same dataset, we suggest that this greater recruitment of the right dlPFC monitors the shift from egocentered and first-person-like mechanisms in the MNS to heterocentered and second-person-like mechanisms in the left temporo-parietal junction within the MENT, i.e., reflecting the onset of perspective-change processes in the neural time course of empathy. Contrasting with sympathy, this recruitment of the executive functions could modulate the output end of the mirroring processing in the premotor and sensorimotor cortices.",
   "Interactions between tactile and proprioceptive representations in haptics.\nNeuroprosthetic limbs, regardless of their sophisticated motor control, require sensory feedback to viably interact with the environment. Toward that aim, the authors examined interrelationships between tactile and proprioceptive sensations. Through human psychophysics experiments, they evaluated error patterns of subjects estimating hand location in a horizontal 2-dimensional workspace under 3 tactile conditions. While tactile cues did not significantly affect the structure of the pattern of errors, touching the workspace reduced estimation errors. During neurophysiological experiments, a macaque grasped textured objects using 2 hand postures. Sensory coding showed dependence on both roughness of the manipulandum and posture. In summary, the authors suggest that tactile sensations underlying haptics are processed in a stable spatial reference frame provided by a proprioceptive system, and that tactile and proprioceptive inputs can be encoded simultaneously by individual cells. Such insights will be useful for providing stable, adaptive sensory feedback for neuroprosthetics.",
   "Electrostimulation as a prosthesis for repair of information flow in a computer model of neocortex.\nDamage to a cortical area reduces not only information transmitted to other cortical areas, but also activation of these areas. This phenomenon, whereby the dynamics of a follower area are dramatically altered, is typically manifested as a marked reduction in activity. Ideally, neuroprosthetic stimulation would replace both information and activation. However, replacement of activation alone may be valuable as a means of restoring dynamics and information processing of other signals in this multiplexing system. We used neuroprosthetic stimulation in a computer model of the cortex to repair activation dynamics, using a simple repetitive stimulation to replace the more complex, naturalistic stimulation that had been removed. We found that we were able to restore activity in terms of neuronal firing rates. Additionally, we were able to restore information processing, measured as a restoration of causality between an experimentally recorded signal fed into the in silico brain and a cortical output. These results indicate that even simple neuroprosthetics that do not restore lost information may nonetheless be effective in improving the functionality of surrounding areas of cortex.",
   "The neural monitoring of visceral inputs, rather than attention, accounts for first-person perspective in conscious vision.\nWhy should a scientist whose aim is to unravel the neural mechanisms of perception consider brain-body interactions seriously? Brain-body interactions have traditionally been associated with emotion, effort, or stress, but not with the \"cold\" processes of perception and attention. Here, we review recent experimental evidence suggesting a different picture: the neural monitoring of bodily state, and in particular the neural monitoring of the heart, affects visual perception. The impact of spontaneous fluctuations of neural responses to heartbeats on visual detection is as large as the impact of explicit manipulations of spatial attention in perceptual tasks. However, we propose that the neural monitoring of visceral inputs plays a specific role in conscious perception, distinct from the role of attention. The neural monitoring of organs such as the heart or the gut would generate a subject-centered reference frame, from which the first-person perspective inherent to conscious perception can develop. In this view, conscious perception results from the integration of visual content with first-person perspective.",
   "Modification of standard CMOS technology for cell-based biosensors.\nWe present an electrode based on complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology that can be made fully biocompatible and chemically inert using a simple, low-cost and non-specialised process. Since these devices are based on ubiquitous CMOS technology, the integrated circuits can be readily developed to include appropriate amplifiers, filters and wireless subsystems, thus reducing the complexity and cost of external systems. The unprocessed CMOS aluminium electrodes are modified using anodisation and plating techniques which do not require intricate and expensive semiconductor processing equipment and can be performed on the bench-top as a clean-room environment is not required. The resulting transducers are able to detect both the fast electrical activity of neurons and the slow changes in impedance of growing and dividing cells. By using standard semiconductor fabrication techniques and well-established technologies, the approach can form the basis of cell-based biosensors and transducers for high throughput drug discovery assays, neuroprosthetics and as a basic research tool in biosciences. The technology is equally applicable to other biosensors that require noble metal or nanoporous microelectrodes.",
   "Intrinsically Stretchable Biphasic (Solid-Liquid) Thin Metal Films.\nStretchable biphasic conductors are formed by physical vapor deposition of gallium onto an alloying metal film. The properties of the photolithography-compatible thin metal films are highlighted by low sheet resistance (0.5 \u03a9 sq(-1) ) and large stretchability (400%). This novel approach to deposit and pattern liquid metals enables extremely robust, multilayer and soft circuits, sensors, and actuators.",
   "Integration of Nanobots Into Neural Circuits As a Future Therapy for Treating Neurodegenerative Disorders.\nRecent neuroscientific research demonstrates that the human brain is becoming altered by technological devices. Improvements in biotechnologies and computer based technologies are now increasing the likelihood for the development of brain augmentation devices in the next 20 years. We have developed the idea of an \"Endomyccorhizae like interface\" (ELI) nanocognitive device as a new kind of future neuroprosthetic which aims to facilitate neuronal network properties in individuals with neurodegenerative disorders. The design of our ELI may overcome the problems of invasive neuroprosthetics, post-operative inflammation, and infection and neuroprosthetic degradation. The method in which our ELI is connected and integrated to neuronal networks is based on a mechanism similar to endomyccorhizae which is the oldest and most widespread form of plant symbiosis. We propose that the principle of Endomyccorhizae could be relevant for developing a crossing point between the ELI and neuronal networks. Similar to endomyccorhizae the ELI will be designed to form webs, each of which connects multiple neurons together. The ELI will function to sense action potentials and deliver it to the neurons it connects to. This is expected to compensate for neuronal loss in some neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.",
   "Gating of tactile information through gamma band during passive arm movement in awake primates.\nTo make precise and prompt action in a dynamic environment, the sensorimotor system needs to integrate all related information. The inflow of somatosensory information to the cerebral cortex is regulated and mostly suppressed by movement, which is commonly referred to as sensory gating or gating. Sensory gating plays an important role in preventing redundant information from reaching the cortex, which should be considered when designing somatosensory neuroprosthetics. Gating can occur at several levels within the sensorimotor pathway, while the underlying mechanism is not yet fully understood. The average sensory evoked potential is commonly used to assess sensory information processing, however the assumption of a stereotyped response to each stimulus is still an open question. Event related spectral perturbation (ERSP), which is the power spectrum after time-frequency decomposition on single trial evoked potentials (total power), could overcome this limitation of averaging and provide additional information for understanding the underlying mechanism. To this aim, neural activities in primary somatosensory cortex (S1), primary motor cortex (M1), and ventral posterolateral (VPL) nucleus of thalamus were recorded simultaneously in two areas (S1 and M1 or S1 and VPL) during passive arm movement and rest in awake monkeys. Our results showed that neural activity at different recording areas demonstrated specific and unique response frequency characteristics. Tactile input induced early high frequency responses followed by low frequency oscillations within sensorimotor circuits, and passive movement suppressed these oscillations either in a phase-locked or non-phase-locked manner. Sensory gating by movement was non-phase-locked in M1, and complex in sensory areas. VPL showed gating of non-phase-locked at gamma band and mix of phase-locked and non-phase-locked at low frequency, while S1 showed gating of phase-locked and non-phase-locked at gamma band and an early phase-locked elevation followed by non-phase-locked gating at low frequency. Granger causality (GC) analysis showed bidirectional coupling between VPL and S1, while GC between M1 and S1 was not responsive to tactile input. Thus, these results suggest that tactile input is dominantly transmitted along the ascending direction from VPL to S1, and the sensory input is suppressed during movement through a bottom-up strategy within the gamma-band during passive movement.",
   "Cytoskeletal actin dynamics are involved in pitch-dependent neurite outgrowth on bead monolayers.\nNeurite outgrowth is an important preceding step for the development of nerve systems. Given that the in\u2005vivo environments of neurons consist of numerous hierarchical micro/nanotopographies, there have been many efforts to investigate the relationship between neuronal behaviors and surface topography. The acceleration of neurite outgrowth was recently reported on surfaces with a periodic nanotopography, but the biological mechanism has not yet been elucidated. In this work, the initial neurite development of hippocampal neurons on assembled silica beads with diameters ranging from 700 to 1800\u2005nm was explored. The acceleration of neurite outgrowth increased with the surface-pitch size and leveled off after a pitch of 1\u2005\u03bcm. Biochemical analysis indicated that cytoskeletal actin dynamics were primarily responsible for the recognition of surface topography. This work contributes to the emerging research field of topographical neurochemistry, as well as applied fields including neuroregeneration and neuroprosthetics.",
   "Lack of additive role of ageing in nigrostriatal neurodegeneration triggered by \u03b1-synuclein overexpression.\nParkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons as well as the presence of proteinaceous inclusions named Lewy bodies. \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) is a major constituent of Lewy bodies, and the first disease-causing protein characterized in PD. Several \u03b1-syn-based animal models of PD have been developed to investigate the pathophysiology of PD, but none of them recapitulate the full picture of the disease. Ageing is the most compelling and major risk factor for developing PD but its impact on \u03b1-syn toxicity remains however unexplored. In this study, we developed and exploited a recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector of serotype 9 overexpressing mutated \u03b1-syn to elucidate the influence of ageing on the dynamics of PD-related neurodegeneration associated with \u03b1-syn pathology in different mammalian species.",
   "Epidural electrocorticography of phantom hand movement following long-term upper-limb amputation.\nProstheses for upper-limb amputees are currently controlled by either myoelectric or peripheral neural signals. Performance and dexterity of these devices is still limited, particularly when it comes to controlling hand function. Movement-related brain activity might serve as a complementary bio-signal for motor control of hand prosthesis.",
   "Inverse estimation of multiple muscle activations from joint moment with muscle synergy extraction.\nHuman movement is produced resulting from synergetic combinations of multiple muscle contractions. The resultant joint movement can be estimated through the related multiple-muscle activities, which is formulated as the forward problem. Neuroprosthetic applications may benefit from cocontraction of agonist and antagonist muscle pairs to achieve more stable and robust joint movements. It is necessary to estimate the activation of each individual muscle from desired joint torque(s), which is the inverse problem. A synergy-based solution is presented for the inverse estimation of multiple muscle activations from joint movement, focusing on one degree-of-freedom tasks. The approach comprises muscle synergy extraction via the nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm. Cross validation is performed to evaluate the method for prediction accuracy based on experimental data from ten able-bodied subjects. The results demonstrate that the approach succeeds to inversely estimate the multiple muscle activities from the given joint torque sequence. In addition, the other one's averaged synergy ratio was applied for muscle activation estimation with leave-one-out cross-validation manner, which resulted in 9.3% estimation error over all the subjects. The obtained results support the common muscle synergy-based neuroprosthetics control concept.",
   "Social perception of others shapes one's own multisensory peripersonal space.\nThe perception of our self is not restricted to our physical boundaries, but it extends beyond the body to incorporate the space where individual-environment interactions occur, i.e., the peripersonal space (PPS). PPS is generally conceived as a low-level multisensory-motor interface mediating hand-object interactions. Recent studies, however, showed that PPS representation is affected by higher-level cognitive factors. Here we asked whether the multisensory representation of PPS is influenced by high-level mechanisms implied in social interactions, such as the social perception of others. To this aim, in Experiment 1, we developed and validated a new multisensory interaction task in mixed reality (i.e., the Social PPS task). This task allows measuring the boundaries of PPS between one self and another person in a fully controlled, yet highly ecological, set-up. In the Experiment 2, we used this task to measure how participants' PPS varied when facing another person. The social perception of this person was manipulated via a classic social psychology procedure, so that, in two conditions, she was perceived either as a moral or an immoral character. We found that PPS representation is sensitive to the social perception of the other, being more extended when participants were facing a moral than when facing an immoral person. This effect was specific for social context, as no change in PPS was found if participants were facing an object, instead of the person. Interestingly, the social manipulation affected also attitude, identification, willingness to interact with the other, so as interpersonal distance. Together these findings show that social perception of others affects both the psychological representation of the others in relation to oneself and the multisensory representations of the space between oneself and the other, offering new insights about the role of social cognition in body representation.",
   "Peptide-based coatings for flexible implantable neural interfaces.\nIn the last decade, the use of flexible biosensors for neuroprosthetic and translational applications has\u00a0widely increased. Among them, the polyimide (PI)-based thin-film electrodes got a large popularity. However, the usability of these devices is still hampered by a non-optimal tissue-device interface that usually compromises the long-term quality of neural signals. Advanced strategies able to improve the surface properties of these devices have been developed in the recent past. Unfortunately, most of them are not easy to be developed and combined with micro-fabrication processes, and require long-term efforts to be testable with human subjects. Here we show the results of the design and in vitro testing of an easy-to-implement and potentially interesting coating approach for thin-film electrodes. In particular, two biocompatible coatings were obtained via covalent conjugation of a laminin-derived peptide, CAS-IKVAV-S (IKV), with polyimide sheets that we previously functionalized with vinyl- and amino- groups (PI_v and PI_a respectively). Both the engineered coatings (PI_v+IKV and PI_a+IKV) showed morphological and chemical properties able to support neuronal adhesion, neurite sprouting, and peripheral glial cell viability while reducing the fibroblasts contamination of the substrate. In particular, PI_v+IKV showed promising results that encourage further in vivo investigation and pave the way for a new generation of peptide-coated thin-film electrodes.",
   "Somnomat: a novel actuated bed to investigate the effect of vestibular stimulation.\nRocking movements are known to affect human sleep. Previous studies have demonstrated that the transition from wake to sleep can be facilitated by rocking movements, which might be related to relaxation. However, it is not yet known which movements would have the greatest effect. Thus, a 6-degree-of-freedom tendon-based robotic bed was developed, for systematic evaluation of vestibular stimuli. The applicability of the device was evaluated with 25 subjects. Six movement axes were tested and analyzed for differences in promoting relaxation. Relaxation was assessed by electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, respiration and a questionnaire. The developed device fulfilled all needed requirements proving the applicability of this technology. Movements had no significant effects on the electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram. Respiration frequency was significantly lower for baseline measurements without movement (median 0.183-0.233\u00a0Hz) compared to movement conditions (median 0.283-0.300\u00a0Hz). Questionnaire ratings showed a trend (p\u00a0=\u00a00.057) toward higher relaxation for movements along the vertical axis (z-axis) (median 4.67; confidence interval 4.33-5.67) compared to the roll-axis (median 4.33; confidence interval 3.67-5.00). Movements along the vertical axis (z-axis), therefore, appear most promising in promoting relaxation, though no effects were found in electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram variables. This lack of effect might be attributed to the short exposure to the movements and the large inter-individual variability and individual preferences among subjects.",
   "Electrode failure: tissue, electrical, and material responses.\nThe development of invasive, rehabilitative neuroprosthetics for humans requires reliable neural probes that are capable of recording large ensembles of neurons for a long period of time. Recent advances in the development of neuroprosthetics in animals and humans have shown that communication and control can be directly derived from the central nervous system (CNS) for restoring lost motor ability. This proof of concept has opened the possibility of new therapies for the millions of individuals suffering from neurological disorders of the nervous system. The success of these therapies hinges on the ability to reliably access the relevant signals from the brain with high quality for the lifetime of the patient. As a result, research has focused on the cascade of events that follow chronic implantation of microelectrodes and temporal degradation in the signal and electrode quality: signal-to-noise ratio, noise floor, peak amplitude, and neuronal yield. Implanted microelectrodes have been reported to suffer from time-dependent degradation in signal quality due to unknown issues related to tissue interfaces.",
   "Decoding of human hand actions to handle missing limbs in neuroprosthetics.\nThe only way we can interact with the world is through movements, and our primary interactions are via the hands, thus any loss of hand function has immediate impact on our quality of life. However, to date it has not been systematically assessed how coordination in the hand's joints affects every day actions. This is important for two fundamental reasons. Firstly, to understand the representations and computations underlying motor control \"in-the-wild\" situations, and secondly to develop smarter controllers for prosthetic hands that have the same functionality as natural limbs. In this work we exploit the correlation structure of our hand and finger movements in daily-life. The novelty of our idea is that instead of averaging variability out, we take the view that the structure of variability may contain valuable information about the task being performed. We asked seven subjects to interact in 17 daily-life situations, and quantified behavior in a principled manner using CyberGlove body sensor networks that, after accurate calibration, track all major joints of the hand. Our key findings are: (1) We confirmed that hand control in daily-life tasks is very low-dimensional, with four to five dimensions being sufficient to explain 80-90% of the variability in the natural movement data. (2) We established a universally applicable measure of manipulative complexity that allowed us to measure and compare limb movements across tasks. We used Bayesian latent variable models to model the low-dimensional structure of finger joint angles in natural actions. (3) This allowed us to build a na\u00efve classifier that within the first 1000 ms of action initiation (from a flat hand start configuration) predicted which of the 17 actions was going to be executed-enabling us to reliably predict the action intention from very short-time-scale initial data, further revealing the foreseeable nature of hand movements for control of neuroprosthetics and tele operation purposes. (4) Using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm on our latent variable model permitted us to reconstruct with high accuracy (<5-6\u00b0 MAE) the movement trajectory of missing fingers by simply tracking the remaining fingers. Overall, our results suggest the hypothesis that specific hand actions are orchestrated by the brain in such a way that in the natural tasks of daily-life there is sufficient redundancy and predictability to be directly exploitable for neuroprosthetics.",
   "Cochlear Implantation, Enhancements, Transhumanism and Posthumanism: Some Human Questions.\nBiomedical engineering technologies such as brain-machine interfaces and neuroprosthetics are advancements which assist human beings in varied ways. There are exciting yet speculative visions of how the neurosciences and bioengineering may influence human nature. However, these could be preparing a possible pathway towards an enhanced and even posthuman future. This article seeks to investigate several ethical themes and wider questions of enhancement, transhumanism and posthumanism. Four themes of interest are: autonomy, identity, futures, and community. Three larger questions can be asked: will everyone be enhanced? Will we be \"human\" if we are not, one\u00a0day, transhuman? Should we be enhanced or not? The article proceeds by concentrating on a widespread and sometimes controversial application: the cochlear implant, an auditory prosthesis implanted into Deaf patients. Cochlear implantation and its reception in both the deaf and hearing communities have a distinctive moral discourse, which can offer surprising insights. The paper begins with several points about the enhancement of human beings, transhumanism's reach beyond the human, and posthuman aspirations. Next it focuses on cochlear implants on two sides. Firstly, a shorter consideration of what technologies may do to humans in a transhumanist world. Secondly, a deeper analysis of cochlear implantation's unique socio-political movement, its ethical explanations and cultural experiences linked with pediatric cochlear implantation-and how those wary of being thrust towards posthumanism could marshal such ideas by analogy. As transhumanism approaches, the issues and questions merit continuing intense analysis.",
   "Developing implantable neuroprosthetics: a new model in pig.\nA new model has been established in the domestic pig for neural prosthetic device development and testing. To this end, we report on a complete neural prosthetic developmental system using a wireless sensor as the implant, a pig as the animal model, and a novel data acquisition paradigm for actuator control. A new type of stereotactic frame with clinically-inspired fixations pins that place the pig brain in standard surgical plane was developed and tested with success during the implantation of the microsystem. The microsystem implanted was an ultra-low power (12.5 mW) 16-channel intracortical/epicranial device transmitting broadband (40 kS/s) data over a wireless infrared telemetric link. Pigs were implanted and neural data was collected over a period of 5 weeks, clearly showing single unit spiking activity.",
   "Neuroprostheses for increasing disabled patients' mobility and control.\nNeuroprostheses are electronic devices using electrophysiological signals to stimulate muscles, electronic/ mechanical devices such as substitutes for limbs or parts of limbs, or computers. The development of neuroprostheses was possible thanks to advances in understanding of the physiology of the human brain and in the capabilities of hardware and software. Recent progress in the area of neuroprosthetics may offer important breakthroughs in therapy and rehabilitation. New dedicated solutions for disabled people can lead to their increased participation in social, educational and professional areas. It is worth focussing particular attention on new solutions for people with paralysis, people with communication disorders and amputees. This article aims at investigating the extent to which the available opportunities are being exploited, including current and potential future applications of brain-computer interfaces.",
   "Decoding Inner Speech Using Electrocorticography: Progress and Challenges Toward a Speech Prosthesis.\nCertain brain disorders resulting from brainstem infarcts, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, stroke, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, limit verbal communication despite the patient being fully aware. People that cannot communicate due to neurological disorders would benefit from a system that can infer internal speech directly from brain signals. In this review article, we describe the state of the art in decoding inner speech, ranging from early acoustic sound features, to higher order speech units. We focused on intracranial recordings, as this technique allows monitoring brain activity with high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution, and therefore is a good candidate to investigate inner speech. Despite intense efforts, investigating how the human cortex encodes inner speech remains an elusive challenge, due to the lack of behavioral and observable measures. We emphasize various challenges commonly encountered when investigating inner speech decoding, and propose potential solutions in order to get closer to a natural speech assistive device.",
   "Muscle synergies and spinal maps are sensitive to the asymmetry induced by a unilateral stroke.\nPrevious studies have shown that a cerebrovascular accident disrupts the coordinated control of leg muscles during locomotion inducing asymmetric gait patterns. However, the ability of muscle synergies and spinal maps to reflect the redistribution of the workload between legs after the trauma has not been investigated so far.",
   "Shared electrophysiology mechanisms of body ownership and motor imagery.\nAlthough we feel, see, and experience our hands as our own (body or hand ownership), recent research has shown that illusory hand ownership can be induced for fake or virtual hands and may be useful for neuroprosthetics and brain-computer interfaces. Despite the vast amount of behavioral data on illusory hand ownership, neuroimaging studies are rare, in particular electrophysiological studies. Thus, while the neural systems underlying hand ownership are relatively well described, the spectral signatures of body ownership as measured by electroencephalography (EEG) remain elusive. Here we induced illusory hand ownership in an automated, computer-controlled manner using virtual reality while recording 64-channel EEG and found that illusory hand ownership is reflected by a body-specific modulation in the mu-band over fronto-parietal cortex. In a second experiment in the same subjects, we then show that mu as well as beta-band activity in highly similar fronto-parietal regions was also modulated during a motor imagery task often used in paradigms employing non-invasive brain-computer interface technology. These data provide insights into the electrophysiological brain mechanisms of illusory hand ownership and their strongly overlapping mechanisms with motor imagery in fronto-parietal cortex. They also highlight the potential of combining high-resolution EEG with virtual reality setups and automatized stimulation protocols for systematic, reproducible stimulus presentation in cognitive neuroscience, and may inform the design of non-invasive brain-computer interfaces.",
   "Advantages of soft subdural implants for the delivery of electrochemical neuromodulation therapies to the spinal cord.\nWe recently developed soft neural interfaces enabling the delivery of electrical and chemical stimulation to the spinal cord. These stimulations restored locomotion in animal models of paralysis. Soft interfaces can be placed either below or above the dura mater. Theoretically, the subdural location combines many advantages, including increased selectivity of electrical stimulation, lower stimulation thresholds, and targeted chemical stimulation through local drug delivery. However, these advantages have not been documented, nor have their functional impact been studied in silico or in a relevant animal model of neurological disorders using a multimodal neural interface.",
   "Bodily ownership and self-location: components of bodily self-consciousness.\nRecent research on bodily self-consciousness has assumed that it consists of three distinct components: the experience of owning a body (body ownership); the experience of being a body with a given location within the environment (self-location); and the experience of taking a first-person, body-centered, perspective on that environment (perspective). Here we review recent neuroimaging studies suggesting that at least two of these components-body ownership and self-location-are implemented in rather distinct neural substrates, located, respectively, in the premotor cortex and in the temporo-parietal junction. We examine these results and consider them in relation to clinical evidence from patients with altered body perception and work on a variety of multisensory, body-related illusions, such as the rubber hand illusion, the full body illusion, the body swap illusion and the enfacement illusion. We conclude by providing a preliminary synthesis of the data on bodily self-consciousness and its neural correlates.",
   "Bodily self-consciousness and its disorders.\nResearch in clinical and human neuroscience indicates that important brain mechanisms of self-consciousness are based on the integration of multisensory bodily signals (i.e., bodily self-consciousness: BSC), including signals coming from outside our body (i.e., exteroceptive signals, such as tactile, auditory, and visual information) and the inside of our body (i.e., interoceptive signals). In this chapter, we discuss selected behavioral and neuroimaging studies about how multisensory integration generates and modulates BSC in humans, with particular relevance to parietal mechanisms. We then review the neurology of disorders of BSC after acquired brain damage or dysfunction, ranging from body attentional disorders to delusional and illusory deficits about the patient's own body, associated with a breakdown of the link between the body and the self.",
   "Virtual reality system in conjunction with neurorobotics and neuroprosthetics for rehabilitation of motor disorders.\nCerebrovascular accidents (CVA) and spinal cord injuries (SCI) are the most common causes of paralysis and paresis with reported prevalence of 12,000 cases per million and 800 cases per million, respectively. Disabilities that follow CVA (hemiplegia) or SCI (paraplegia, tetraplegia) severely impair motor functions (e.g., standing, walking, reaching and grasping) and prevent the affected individuals from healthy-like, full and autonomous participation in daily activities. Our research focuses on the development of a new virtual reality (VR) system combined with wearable neurorobotics (NR), motor-neuroprosthetics (MNP) and brain neuro-machine interface (BNMI) to overcome the major limitations of current rehabilitation solutions.",
   "Subthalamic Neural Activity Patterns Anticipate Economic Risk Decisions in Gambling.\nEconomic decision-making is disrupted in individuals with gambling disorder, an addictive behavior observed in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients receiving dopaminergic therapy. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is involved in the inhibition of impulsive behaviors; however, its role in impulse control disorders and addiction is still unclear. Here, we recorded STN local field potentials (LFPs) in PD patients with and without gambling disorder during an economic decision-making task. Reaction times analysis showed that for all patients, the decision whether to risk preceded task onset. We compared then for both groups the STN LFP preceding high- and low-risk economic decisions. We found that risk avoidance in gamblers correlated with larger STN LFP low-frequency (<12-Hz) fluctuations preceding task onset. In particular, the amplitude of low-frequency LFP fluctuations carried significant information about future decisions. Decisions of patients not affected by gambling disorder were instead not correlated with pretask STN LFP. Our results suggest that STN activity preceding task onset affects risk decisions by preemptively inhibiting attraction to high but unlikely rewards in favor of a long-term payoff.",
   "Area-Power Efficient VLSI Implementation of Multichannel DWT for Data Compression in Implantable Neuroprosthetics.\nTime-frequency domain signal processing of neural recordings, from high-density microelectrode arrays implanted in the cortex, is highly desired to ease the bandwidth bottleneck associated with data transfer to extra-cranial processing units. Because of its energy compactness features, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) has been shown to provide efficient data compression for neural records without compromising the information content. This paper describes an area-power minimized hardware implementation of the lifting scheme for multilevel, multichannel DWT with quantized filter coefficients and integer computation. Performance tradeoffs and key design decisions for implantable neuroprosthetics are presented. A 32-channel 4-level version of the circuit has been custom designed in 0.18-mum CMOS and occupies only 0.22 mm(2) area and consumes 76 muW of power, making it highly suitable for implantable neural interface applications requiring wireless data transfer.",
   "Zebrafish models relevant to studying central opioid and endocannabinoid systems.\nThe endocannabinoid and opioid systems are two interplaying neurotransmitter systems that modulate drug abuse, anxiety, pain, cognition, neurogenesis and immune activity. Although they are involved in such critical functions, our understanding of endocannabinoid and opioid physiology remains limited, necessitating further studies, novel models and new model organisms in this field. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is rapidly emerging as one of the most effective translational models in neuroscience and biological psychiatry. Due to their high physiological and genetic homology to humans, zebrafish may be effectively used to study the endocannabinoid and opioid systems. Here, we discuss current models used to target the endocannabinoid and opioid systems in zebrafish, and their potential use in future translational research and high-throughput drug screening. Emphasizing the high degree of conservation of the endocannabinoid and opioid systems in zebrafish and mammals, we suggest zebrafish as an excellent model organism to study these systems and to search for the new drugs and therapies targeting their evolutionarily conserved mechanisms.",
   "Virtual Reality as a Vehicle to Empower Motor-Cognitive Neurorehabilitation.\nIn this paper, we advocate the combination of four key ingredients that we believe are necessary to design long-lasting effective treatments for neurorehabilitation: (i) motor-cognitive training, (ii) evidence-based neuroscience principles, in particular those related to body perception, (iii) motivational games, and (iv) empowerment techniques. Then, we propose virtual reality (VR) as the appropriate medium to encompass all the requirements mentioned above. VR is arguably one of the most suitable technologies for neurorehabilitation able to integrate evidence-based neurorehabilitation techniques and neuroscience principles into motivating training approaches that promote self-management by empowering patients to own their recovery process. We discuss the advantages and challenges of such an approach on several exemplary applications and outline directions for future developments. We strongly believe that the combination of positive psychology and positive technology mediated by VR-based interventions can heavily impact the rehabilitation outcomes of motor-cognitive functions along all the stages of the rehabilitation path."
